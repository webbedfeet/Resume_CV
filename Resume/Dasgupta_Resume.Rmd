aboutme: "I am an expert statistician and data scientist interested in multidisciplinary collaborations to understand and solve problems using modern data analytic tools and techniques. I work at the interface of statistics and machine learning, and have extensive experience (SME) in statistical methods, study design, machine learning and data visualization. I am an expert in using R and Python for data analytics and data science applied to a wide variety of disciplines, with over 20 years experience. I am an excellent communicator and teacher who can explain technical details well to a non-technical audience. I am also interested in the mentoring, education and training of the next generation of data scientists."
