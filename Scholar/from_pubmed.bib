  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minorities on dialysis survive longer than whites, and are less likely to discontinue dialysis. Both differences have been attributed by some clinicians to better health among minorities on dialysis.
METHODS: To test if racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation reflected better health, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of survival and dialysis discontinuation among patients on maintenance dialysis in the US Renal Data System after hospitalization for either stroke (n=60,734), lung cancer (n=4100), dementia (n=40,084), or failure to thrive (n=42,950) between 2003 and 2014. We examined the frequency of discontinuation of dialysis and used simulations to estimate survival in minorities relative to whites if minorities had the same pattern of dialysis discontinuation as whites.
RESULTS: Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had substantially lower frequencies of dialysis discontinuation than whites in each hospitalization cohort. Observed risks of mortality were also lower for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In simulations that assigned discontinuation patterns similar to those found among whites across racial and ethnic groups, differences in survival were markedly attenuated and hazard ratios approached 1.0. Survival and dialysis discontinuation frequencies among American Indians and Alaska Natives were close to those of whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation were present among patients hospitalized with similar health events. Among these patients, survival differences between racial and ethnic minorities and whites were largely attributable to differences in the frequency of discontinuation of dialysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the risk of mortality in patients with SLE hospitalized with sepsis varies among hospitals in the USA.
METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample (2002-2011) to obtain national population-based data on outcomes for adults with SLE admitted with sepsis, and compared it with that for patients without SLE admitted with sepsis at the same hospital. We computed expected mortality based on patient demographic characteristics, comorbidities and major organ dysfunction, and calculated observed/expected (O/E) mortality ratios separately for patients with SLE and without SLE for each hospital. We then computed the ratio of these O/E ratios within hospitals to assess relative SLE mortality. We considered hospitals with a risk ratio (RR) of ⩾2.0 as having high relative SLE mortality.
RESULTS: Among 424 hospitals that treated a total of 4024 patients with SLE and sepsis, the risk of in-hospital mortality varied from 0\% to 60\% (median 11.1\%). The RR ranged from 0 to 9.75, with a median of 0.84, indicating that O/E mortality was similar in patients with and without SLE at the average hospital. Sixty-one hospitals (14.4\%) had a RR of ⩾2.0, indicating higher mortality among patients with SLE. Hospitals that on average treated ⩾3.9 patients with SLE and sepsis annually were less likely to have a RR of ⩾2.0 than hospitals that treated fewer patients (10\% vs 17\%; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Mortality among patients with SLE and sepsis varied widely between hospitals, and was lower at hospitals that treated more of these patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aorta inhibits paravertebral ossification in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. We investigated if syndesmophytes in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) occurred less often at the vertebral rim near the aorta.
METHODS: We performed thoracolumbar CT scans in 60 subjects in this cross-sectional study. The mid-thoracic spine was also scanned in 22 subjects. We divided the rim of each intervertebral disc space (IDS) into 72 angular sectors, each of 5°. We computed syndesmophyte height in each sector, and the distance from the sector to the aorta. We evaluated if syndesmophyte size or frequency in a sector was associated with its distance from the aorta.
RESULTS: In the 180° region of the vertebral rim centered on the sector closest to the aorta, syndesmophyte height and/or frequency varied with the distance of the sector to the aorta, with the lowest frequency and smallest mean syndesmophyte height at the sector along the rim nearest the aorta. Additionally, syndesmophytes were less common in subjects and at IDSs where the aorta was anatomically closer to the vertebra. No syndesmophytes were present in the sector closest to the aorta in subjects whose aorta-vertebral distance was less than 2 mm, but syndesmophytes were progressively more common among subjects whose aortas lay further from the rim.
CONCLUSIONS: Syndesmophytes occurred less commonly and were smaller at the thoracolumbar vertebral rim near the aorta. These findings suggest that mechanical factors extrinsic to the spine and not solely vertebral inflammation, influence syndesmophyte development in AS.},

  abstract = {The portable high-efficiency air filtration (PHEAF) device is an engineering control common to the environmental remediation industry. Damage to the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter (e.g., filtration media, gasket), improper installation of the filter into the mounting frame, or defects in the filtration housing affect the capture efficiency of the device. PHEAF devices operating at less than marketed efficiencies justify periodic leak testing of the PHEAF device, especially when the filtered air is exhausted into occupied spaces. A leak test is accomplished by injecting a known concentration of aerosol upstream of the HEPA filter and measuring the percentage of aerosol penetrating through the filtration system. The test protocol scripted for stationary systems (i.e., biological safety cabinets) states that upstream concentrations can be empirically determined using the aerosol photometer to measure particulate matter (PM) in the airstream. This practice requires a homogenous mixture of the aerosol challenge agent within the airstream. However, design of the PHEAF device does not include a validated induction point for the aerosol. Absent of an acceptable means to achieve a homogenous mixture for upstream measurement, the aerosol concentration is mathematically derived based on the measured air volume passing through the PHEAF equipment. In this study, intake volume and exhaust volume for each PHEAF device were measured by either the balometer or the hot wire anemometer. Variability of measurements was examined by instrument and sample location (intake vs. exhaust) to understand which combination would be most consistent for measuring airflow volume. From this study, the authors conclude that the balometer is preferred compared with the hot wire anemometer for measuring airflow through the PHEAF device. Exhaust measurement by balometer seems more reliable than intake measurements by hot wire anemometer. Implications: Although testing of PHEAF devices is recommended by various public health authorities, no nationally recognized test protocol has been published in the United States. In support of measuring the performance of the PHEAF device in a field setting, this study evaluated the hot wire anemometer and balometer techniques and sample locations (intake vs. exhaust) to reliably measure airflow through the PHEAF device. Since accuracy of the particle measurement is associated with airflow volume, it is essential to obtain a true airflow reading. This study suggests that the balometer was more consistent in measuring airflow through the PHEAF device.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Direct comparison trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) increasingly use changes in continuous disease activity measures as endpoints. However, the between-arm differences in these scores that are clinically meaningful are uncertain. To aid interpretation of clinical trials that use the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) or Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) as endpoints, we developed statistical equivalences between changes in these measures and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses.
METHODS: For superiority trials, we computed the minimal detectable difference in DAS28 changes and SDAI changes that correspond to the ACR criteria for 20\% improvement (ACR20) and 50\% improvement (ACR50) responses at the same type I and type II errors and same sample size. For noninferiority trials, we computed noninferiority margins that were statistically equivalent across measures. Standard deviations of the changes in the DAS28 and SDAI from a recent observational study were used as the basis of calculations in our examples.
RESULTS: In the base scenario with type 1 error 0.05 and power 0.80, a trial with 300 subjects per arm would detect a 0.31-point difference in mean DAS28 change scores and 3.71-point difference in mean SDAI change scores as statistically equivalent to an absolute difference of 11\% in ACR20 between treatment arms. We developed a web-based utility that provides equivalent differences among these measures for customized sample sizes, error rates, and standard deviations of the DAS28 and SDAI between-arm differences.
CONCLUSION: The DAS28 and SDAI responses can be related to statistically equivalent changes in ACR responses, which can aid the interpretation of trials that use these measures.},

  abstract = {Melorheostosis (MEL) is a rare disease of high bone mass with patchy skeletal distribution affecting the long bones. We recently reported somatic mosaic mutations in MAP2K1 in 8 of 15 patients with the disease. The unique anatomic distribution of melorheostosis is of great interest. The disease remains limited to medial or lateral side of the extremity with proximo-distal progression. This pattern of distribution has historically been attributed to sclerotomes (area of bone which is innervated by a single spinal nerve level). In a further analysis of our study on MEL, 30 recruited patients underwent whole body CT scans to characterize the anatomic distribution of the disease. Two radiologists independently reviewed these scans and compared it to the proposed map of sclerotomes. We found that the disease distribution conformed to the distribution of a single sclerotome in only 5 patients (17\%). In another 12 patients, the lesions spanned parts of contiguous sclerotomes but did not involve the entire extent of the sclerotomes. Our findings raise concerns about the sclerotomal hypothesis being the definitive explanation for the pattern of anatomic distribution in MEL. We believe that the disease distribution can be explained by clonal proliferation of a mutated skeletal progenitor cell along the limb axis. Studies in mice models on clonal proliferation in limb buds mimic the patterns seen in melorheostosis. We also support this hypothesis by the dorso-ventral confinement of melorheostotic lesion in a patient with low allele frequency of MAP2K1-positive osteoblasts and low skeletal burden of the disease. This suggests that the mutation occurred after the formation of dorso-ventral plane. Further studies on limb development are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and pattern of disease distribution in all patients with MEL.},

We recently described somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 as a cause of melorheostosis. Here, we report distinguishing characteristics of patients with MAP2K1-positive melorheostosis. Fifteen unrelated patients with radiographic appearance of melorheostosis underwent paired biopsies of affected and unaffected bone for whole-exome sequencing, histology, and cell culture. Eight patients with mutations in MAP2K1 in affected bone were compared to the seven MAP2K1-negative patients to identify distinguishing characteristics. Patients with MAP2K1-positive melorheostosis had a distinct phenotype with classic "dripping candle-wax" appearance on radiographs (p = 0.01), characteristic vascular lesions on skin overlying affected bone (p = 0.01), and higher prevalence of extraosseous mineralization and joint involvement (p = 0.04 for both). Melorheostotic bone from both MAP2K1-positive and MAP2K1-negative patients showed two zones of distinct morphology-an outer segment of parallel layers of primary lamellar bone and a deeper zone of intensely remodeled highly porous osteonal-like bone. Affected bone from MAP2K1-positive patients showed excessive osteoid (p = 0.0012), increased number of osteoblasts (p = 0.012) and osteoclasts (p = 0.04), and increased vascularity on histology in comparison to paired unaffected bone which was not seen in affected bone in most MAP2K1-negative patients. The identification of a distinct phenotype of patients with MAP2K1-positive melorheostosis demonstrates clinical and genetic heterogeneity among patients with the disease.

METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, we examined responses of 243 patients with active RA to escalation of antirheumatic treatment. We computed agreement between pairs of response criteria using κ coefficients and identified patient characteristics associated with unique responses to individual criteria.
RESULTS: We found that 110 patients (45.3\%) had an ACR 20\% improvement (ACR20) response, 135 (55.5\%) had a EULAR moderate/good response, and 83 (34.1\%) had an SDAI50 response. Agreement was moderate to good (ACR20/EULAR κ 0.57; ACR20/SDAI50 κ 0.64; EULAR/SDAI50 κ 0.59). All who had SDAI50 response also had a EULAR response. Patient characteristics at baseline generally did not distinguish those who responded to both, 1, or neither criterion. Discordance was most often because of improvements in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level among EULAR and SDAI50 responders, which were not as common among ACR20 responders. Based on receiver-operating characteristic curves, SDAI35 response had a better balance of sensitivity and specificity relative to ACR20 and EULAR moderate/good responses than SDAI50.
CONCLUSION: Discordant responses to RA improvement criteria are most often because of differences in responses of acute-phase reactants. SDAI35 response had higher sensitivity for improvement, as reflected by other response criteria, than SDAI50 response.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials of TNFi in patients with active AS. We included trials that reported efficacy at 10 to 14 weeks (12-week analysis) and at 24 to 30 weeks (24-week analysis). We used Bayesian network metaanalysis (NMA) to compare their relative efficacy to improve the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level.
RESULTS: We included 20 trials of 6 TNFi, with 43 treatment arms and 3220 participants. All TNFi were significantly better than placebo in reducing BASDAI and BASFI at 12 weeks and 24 weeks; all but certolizumab pegol (CZP) were statistically better than placebo in reducing CRP at 12 weeks; all but CZP and infliximab-dyyb (IFX biosimilar) were significantly better than placebo in reducing CRP at 24 weeks. IFX was superior to the other TNFi in decreasing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but not at 24 weeks. Excluding 1 open-label trial, there were no differences among TNFi.
CONCLUSION: Based on this NMA of clinical trials, IFX was superior to other TNFi in reducing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but sensitive to inclusion of an open-label trial, and its efficacy was diminished at 24 weeks. The analysis was limited by few direct comparison trials. Further study of relative safety and longterm effectiveness will help inform the choice of TNFi in treating active AS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in survival among adult and paediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from 1950 to the present.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to identify all published cohort studies on survival in patients with SLE. We used Bayesian methods to derive pooled survival estimates separately for adult and paediatric patients, as well as for studies from high-income countries and low/middle-income countries. We pooled contemporaneous studies to obtain trends in survival over time. We also examined trends in major causes of death.
RESULTS: We identified 125 studies of adult patients and 51 studies of paediatric patients. Among adults, survival improved gradually from the 1950s to the mid-1990s in both high-income and low/middle-income countries, after which survival plateaued. In 2008-2016, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year pooled survival estimates in adults from high-income countries were 0.95, 0.89 and 0.82, and in low/middle-income countries were 0.92, 0.85 and 0.79, respectively. Among children, in 2008-2016, the 5-year and 10-year pooled survival estimates from high-income countries were 0.99 and 0.97, while in low/middle-income countries were 0.85 and 0.79, respectively. The proportion of deaths due to SLE decreased over time in studies of adults and among children from high-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: After a period of major improvement, survival in SLE has plateaued since the mid-1990s. In high-income countries, 5-year survival exceeds 0.95 in both adults and children. In low/middle-income countries, 5-year and 10-year survival was lower among children than adults.},

We tested whether RA activity and psychological measures had direct associations with the PGA or indirect associations that were mediated by pain. We also tested whether the correlates of the PGA differed with the degree of RA activity.
METHODS: We studied 260 patients with active RA on 2 visits in a prospective longitudinal study. We used path analysis to test direct and indirect associations of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), fatigue, physical role limitations, social functioning, depressive symptoms, and health distress with the PGA.
RESULTS: Among the 509 visits, the median PGA score was 50 (25th-75th percentile: 24-66). Pain severity had the strongest association with the PGA, but direct associations were also found for morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28. Morning stiffness severity, DAS28, health distress, and HAQ were also indirectly associated with the PGA through pain. Among visits with DAS28 ≥5.4, pain, morning stiffness severity, and HAQ were the only determinants of the PGA. Among visits with DAS28 <4.2, health distress and age were additional determinants, and fatigue was marginally associated with the PGA.
CONCLUSION: Although pain was the strongest determinant of the PGA in RA, morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28 were also important. Determinants of the PGA differed with RA activity, with health distress, age, and to a lesser degree, fatigue, contributing only in patients with less active RA.},

As the number of arthroplasties has increased, it is not known whether surgical cases have shifted to high-volume hospitals. In this study, we examined the change in the volume of arthroplasties to provide a contemporary definition of "high-volume" centers, quantified surgical volume that shifted to high-volume centers, and investigated the resulting effect on complications.
METHODS: Data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (2000 to 2012) were used to quantify trends in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume. Elective primary THAs and TKAs were identified and grouped by hospital by utilizing the hospital identifier, which indicates the geographic location of the hospital. County geographic and population data were obtained from the U.S. Census, and the distances between hospitals and the centroids of counties were calculated. Risk-standardized surgical complication rates for hospitals (2009 to 2012) were obtained from Medicare Hospital Compare and grouped by hospital volume.
RESULTS: From 2000 to 2012, there was a marked increase in the number of hospitals that performed a combined volume of ≥400 elective primary THAs and TKAs. The number of elective primary TKAs and THAs performed annually increased from 343,000 to 851,000. In 2012, 65.5\% of the arthroplasties were performed in high-volume hospitals (≥400 arthroplasties annually), and 26.6\% of the arthroplasties were performed in very high-volume hospitals (≥1,000 procedures annually). The proportion of arthroplasties performed in low-volume hospitals (<100 arthroplasties annually) shrank from 17.9\% to 5.4\%. Very high-volume hospitals had the lowest complication rates (2.745 per 100; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.56 to 2.93), and low-volume hospitals had the highest complication rates (3.610 per 100; 95\% CI, 3.58 to 3.64; p < 0.0001) (odds ratio, 1.327; 95\% CI, 1.26 to 1.40). Our analysis showed that 81.9\% of the U.S. population lived within 50 miles of a high-volume hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroplasty patients are electing to have their procedures at higher-volume hospitals in the United States. Each successively higher hospital volume category manifested a lower complication rate.},

However, in contrast to the established genome-wide significance threshold, no clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs should be selected for downstream analyses.
RESULTS: We propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent relative variable importance measure (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative to an observed minimal importance score for several runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in all of the runs are selected as important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show that the new method controls the number of false-positives under the null hypothesis. Under a simple alternative hypothesis with several independent main effects it is only slightly less powerful than logistic regression. In an experimental GWAS data set, the same strong signal is identified while the approach selects none of the SNPs in an underpowered GWAS.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel variable selection method r2VIM is a promising extension to standard RF for objectively selecting relevant SNPs in GWAS while controlling the number of false-positive results.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major consequence of lupus nephritis, but how this risk has changed over time is unknown. We conducted this systematic review to examine changes in ESRD among adults with lupus nephritis from 1971 to 2015 and to estimate risks of ESRD among contemporary patients.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for cohort studies and clinical trials on ESRD in adults with lupus nephritis. We analyzed studies from developed and developing countries separately. The outcome was probability of ESRD at 5, 10, and 15 years of lupus nephritis.
RESULTS: We included 187 articles that reported on 18,309 patients. In developed countries, the 5-year risk of ESRD decreased from 16\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 14-17\%) in 1970-1979 to 11\% (95\% CI 10-12\%) in the mid-1990s and then plateaued. ESRD risks at 10 years and 15 years showed steeper declines in the 1970s and 1980s but also plateaued in 1993-1997, with a notable increase in the late 2000s. The decrease in risk after 1980 coincided with increased use of cyclophosphamide. The 15-year ESRD risk was higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Patients with class IV lupus nephritis had the greatest risk of ESRD, with a 15-year risk of 44\% during the 2000s.
CONCLUSION: Risks of ESRD in lupus nephritis improved between the 1970s and the mid-1990s and then plateaued, with an increase in the late 2000s. This pattern suggests limitations in the effectiveness of, or access to, current treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Syndesmophytes in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can occur anywhere along the vertebral rim, but little is known about how and where they develop, and particularly if they first form in certain locations along the rim. This information might provide clues to their aetiology. We examined the spatial distribution of syndesmophytes in the thoracolumbar spine in patients with AS using CT.
METHODS: We performed lumbar spine CT scans in 50 patients and used a validated computer algorithm to measure syndesmophyte heights in six intervertebral disc spaces. We measured heights every five radial degrees around the rim of each superior and inferior vertebral endplate.
RESULTS: Syndesmophytes were observed in 208 of 296 intervertebral disc spaces. Both ascending and descending syndesmophytes were non-randomly distributed along the vertebral rim (p<0.0001 for deviation from uniform distribution). Syndesmophytes occurred most often at the posterolateral vertebral rim, and least commonly at the posterior rim and anterior rim. In disc spaces with only small isolated syndesmophytes, these were also most likely to occur at the posterolateral rim. Syndesmophyte distribution varied with the vertebral level. Localisation at the posterolateral rim was most pronounced at T10-T11, T12-T12 and T12-L1, while L2-L3 and L3-L4 exhibited little localisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Syndesmophytes are not randomly distributed around the vertebral rim, as might be expected if they develop solely in response to inflammation. Rather, they preferentially occur, and likely develop first, at the posterolateral rim. Studying factors that can lead to this pattern may help elucidate how syndesmophytes develop.},

Using a large longitudinal database, we examined the association between prednisone use and mortality in RA, and whether this risk was modified with concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use, after controlling for propensity for treatment with prednisone and individual DMARDs.
METHODS: In a prospective study of 5,626 patients with RA followed for up to 25 years, we determined the risk of death associated with prednisone use alone and combined treatment of prednisone with methotrexate (MTX) or sulfasalazine. We used the random forests method to generate propensity scores for prednisone use and each DMARD at study entry and during followup. Mortality risks were estimated using multivariate Cox models that included propensity scores.
RESULTS: During followup (median 4.97 years), 666 patients (11.8\%) died. In a multivariate, propensity-adjusted model, prednisone use was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.83 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.03-7.76]). However, there was a significant interaction between prednisone use and MTX use (P = 0.03), so that risk was attenuated when patients were treated with both medications (HR 0.99 [95\% CI 0.18-5.36]). However, combination treatment also weakened the protective association of MTX with mortality. Results were similar for sulfasalazine.
CONCLUSION: Prednisone use was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in patients with RA. This association was mitigated by concomitant DMARD use, but combined treatment also negated the previously reported beneficial association of MTX with survival in RA.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. We included trials that reported efficacy at 2-12 weeks. Efficacy outcomes were the change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. We also examined the number of adverse events. We used Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare effects directly and indirectly between drugs.
RESULTS: We included 26 trials (66 treatment arms) of 20 NSAIDs with 3410 participants in the network meta-analysis. Fifty-eight per cent of trials had fewer than 50 participants. All 20 NSAIDs reduced pain more than placebo (standardised mean difference ranging from -0.65 to -2.2), with 15 NSAIDs significantly better than placebo. Etoricoxib was superior to celecoxib, ketoprofen and tenoxicam in pain reduction, but no other interdrug comparisons were significant. There were no significant differences among NSAIDs in decreases in the duration of morning stiffness or the likelihood of adverse events. Adverse events were uncommon in these short-term studies. In 16 trials that used NSAIDs at full doses, etoricoxib was superior to all but two other NSAIDs in pain reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain in AS than some other NSAIDs, but there was otherwise insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular NSAID was more effective in the treatment of AS. Comparisons were limited by small studies.},

METHODS: We analyzed hospitalizations for pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and opportunistic infections among adults in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We compared rates of hospitalization yearly among patients with SLE and the general population. We also computed odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: In 1996, the estimated number of hospitalizations for pneumonia in patients with SLE was 4,382, followed by sepsis (2,305), skin infections (1,422), urinary tract infections (643), and opportunistic infections (370). Rates were much higher in patients with SLE than in those without SLE, with age-adjusted relative risks ranging from 5.7 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 5.5-6.0) for pneumonia to 9.8 (95\% CI 9.1-10.7) for urinary tract infection in 1996. Risks increased over time, so that by 2011, all relative risks exceeded 12.0. Overall risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in SLE only for opportunistic infections (adjusted OR 1.52 [95\% CI 1.12-2.07]). However, in pneumonia and sepsis, mortality risks were higher in SLE among those who required mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates for serious infections in SLE increased substantially between 1996 and 2011, reaching over 12 times higher than in patients without SLE in 2011. Reasons for this acceleration are unclear. In-hospital mortality was higher among patients with SLE and opportunistic infections and those with pneumonia or sepsis who required mechanical ventilation.},

These types of effects likely contribute to the heritability of complex human traits. Machine learning methods that are capable of identifying interactions, such as Random Forests (RF), are an alternative analysis approach. One caveat to RF is that there is no standardized method of selecting variables so that false positives are reduced while retaining adequate power. To this end, we have developed a novel variable selection method called relative recurrency variable importance metric (r2VIM). This method incorporates recurrency and variance estimation to assist in optimal threshold selection. For this study, we specifically address how this method performs in data with almost completely epistatic effects (i.e. no marginal effects). Our results show that with appropriate parameter settings, r2VIM can identify interaction effects when the marginal effects are virtually nonexistent. It also outperforms logistic regression, which has essentially no power under this type of model when the number of potential features (genetic variants) is large.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Among children <13 years of age with persistent psychosis and contemporaneous decline in functioning, it is often difficult to determine if the diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia (COS) is warranted. Despite decades of experience, we have up to a 44\% false positive screening diagnosis rate among patients identified as having probable or possible COS; final diagnoses are made following inpatient hospitalization and medication washout. Because our lengthy medication-free observation is not feasible in clinical practice, we constructed diagnostic classifiers using screening data to assist clinicians practicing in the community or academic centers.
METHODS: We used cross-validation, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and random forest to determine the best algorithm for classifying COS (n=85) versus histories of psychosis and impaired functioning in children and adolescents who, at screening, were considered likely to have COS, but who did not meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia after medication washout and inpatient observation (n=53). We used demographics, clinical history measures, intelligence quotient (IQ) and screening rating scales, and number of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications as our predictors.
RESULTS: Logistic regression models using nine, four, and two predictors performed well with positive predictive values>90\%, overall accuracy>77\%, and areas under the curve (AUCs)>86\%.
CONCLUSIONS: COS can be distinguished from alternate disorders with psychosis in children and adolescents; greater levels of positive and negative symptoms and lower levels of depression combine to make COS more likely. We include a worksheet so that clinicians in the community and academic centers can predict the probability that a young patient may be schizophrenic, using only two ratings.},

The modENCODE project has improved the D. melanogaster genome annotation by using deep and diverse high-throughput data. Since transcriptional activity that has been evolutionarily conserved is likely to have an advantageous function, we have performed large-scale interspecific comparisons to increase confidence in predicted annotations. To support comparative genomics, we filled in divergence gaps in the Drosophila phylogeny by generating draft genomes for eight new species. For comparative transcriptome analysis, we generated mRNA expression profiles on 81 samples from multiple tissues and developmental stages of 15 Drosophila species, and we performed cap analysis of gene expression in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. We also describe conservation of four distinct core promoter structures composed of combinations of elements at three positions. Overall, each type of genomic feature shows a characteristic divergence rate relative to neutral models, highlighting the value of multispecies alignment in annotating a target genome that should prove useful in the annotation of other high priority genomes, especially human and other mammalian genomes that are rich in noncoding sequences. We report that the vast majority of elements in the annotation are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that the annotation will be an important springboard for functional genetic testing by the Drosophila community. },

It is widely used to obtain the conditional probabilities of the outcome given predictors, as well as predictor effect size estimates using conditional odds ratios.
RESULTS: We show how statistical learning machines for binary outcomes, provably consistent for the nonparametric regression problem, can be used to provide both consistent conditional probability estimation and conditional effect size estimates. Effect size estimates from learning machines leverage our understanding of counterfactual arguments central to the interpretation of such estimates. We show that, if the data generating model is logistic, we can recover accurate probability predictions and effect size estimates with nearly the same efficiency as a correct logistic model, both for main effects and interactions. We also propose a method using learning machines to scan for possible interaction effects quickly and efficiently. Simulations using random forest probability machines are presented.
CONCLUSIONS: The models we propose make no assumptions about the data structure, and capture the patterns in the data by just specifying the predictors involved and not any particular model structure. So they do not run the same risks of model mis-specification and the resultant estimation biases as a logistic model. This methodology, which we call a "risk machine", will share properties from the statistical machine that it is derived from.},

METHODS: Using the Health Beliefs Model, we used path analysis to test direct and indirect effects of time perspective and health beliefs on adherence among 178 people who participated in a community-based survey near Washington, D.C. We measured three time perspectives (future, present fatalistic, and present hedonistic) with the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and medication adherence by self-report.
RESULTS: The total model demonstrated a good fit (RMSEA=0.17, 90\% CI [0.10, 0.28], p=0.003; comparative fit index=0.91). Future time perspective and age showed direct effects on increased medication adherence; an increase by a single unit in future time perspective was associated with a 0.32 standard deviation increase in reported adherence. There were no significant indirect effects of time perspective with reported medication adherence through health beliefs.
CONCLUSION: The findings provide the first evidence that time perspective plays an under-recognized role as a psychological motivator in medication adherence.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patient counseling for medication adherence may be enhanced if clinicians incorporate consideration of the patient's time perspective.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate clinical profile and short-term outcome of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in Indian adult population.
SETTING AND DESIGN: A prospective observational study, conducted at tertiary teaching institute at New Delhi.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with confirmed PNES were enrolled. The diagnosis was based on witnessing the event during video-electroencephalography (Video-EEG) monitoring. A detailed clinical evaluation was done including evaluation for coexistent anxiety or depressive disorders. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of excessive or paucity of movements during PNES attacks. Patients were followed-up to 12 months for their PNES frequency.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. Chi-square and Students t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables respectively.
RESULTS: The mean age at onset of PNES was 25.44 years; with F:M ratio of 9.5:1. Coexistent epilepsy was present in 13 (20.63\%) cases. Twenty-two patients (44\%) with only PNES (n = 50) had received antiepileptic drugs. Out of 63 patients of PNES 24 (38.1\%) had predominant motor phenomenon, whereas 39 (61.9\%) had limp attacks. The common features observed were pre-ictal headache, ictal eye closure, jaw clenching, resistant behavior, ictal weeping, ictal vocalization, and unresponsiveness during episodes. Comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders was seen in 62.3\% and 90.16\% patients, respectively. Short-term (6-12 months) outcome of 45 patients was good (seizure freedom in 46.66\% and >50\% improvement in 24.44\% cases).
CONCLUSION: PNES is common, but frequently misdiagnosed and treated as epileptic seizures. A high index of suspicion is required for an early diagnosis. Proper disclosure of diagnosis and management of the psychiatric comorbidities can improve their outcome.
LIMITATION: Limited sample size and change in seizures frequency as the only parameter for the assessment of the outcome are the two major limitations of our study.},

METHODS: We examined patients every 4-6 months in this prospective longitudinal study. We used mixed linear models to analyze the associations between 10 physical examination measures and the BASFI and HAQ-S.
RESULTS: We studied 411 patients for a median of 1.5 years (median 3 visits). In multivariate analyses, cervical rotation, chest expansion, lateral thoracolumbar flexion, hip motion, tender joint count, and tender enthesis count were equally strongly associated with the BASFI and HAQ-S. Peripheral joint swelling was more strongly associated with the HAQ-S. Individual items of the BASFI were more likely than items of the HAQ-S to be associated with unrelated physical examination measures (e.g., the association between difficulty rising from a chair and cervical rotation), which may have diminished the axial/peripheral distinction for the BASFI.
CONCLUSION: The BASFI and HAQ-S had similar associations with impairments in axial measures, while the HAQ-S had stronger associations with the number of swollen peripheral joints. The HAQ-S should be considered for use in studies focused on spondyloarthritis with peripheral joint involvement.},

METHODS: We studied 5,626 RA patients prospectively for 25 years to determine the risk of death associated with MTX use, modeled in time-varying Cox regression models. We used the random forest method to generate individual propensity scores for MTX use at study entry and during followup in a time-varying manner; these scores were included in the multivariate model. We also investigated whether selective discontinuation of MTX immediately prior to death altered the risk of mortality, and we examined the association of duration of MTX use with survival.
RESULTS: During followup, 666 patients (12\%) died. MTX use was associated with reduced risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30 [95\% confidence interval 0.09-1.03]). Selective MTX cessation immediately before death did not account for the protective association of MTX use with mortality. Only MTX use for >1 year was associated with lower risks of mortality, but associations were not stronger with longer durations of use.
CONCLUSION: MTX use was associated with a 70\% reduction in mortality in RA.},

  abstract = {We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. This, in turn, drives L-lactate secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in epithelial cancer cells, by acting as a paracrine onco-metabolite. We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the "Reverse Warburg Effect," as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer cells. Here, we used MCT4 immuno-staining of human breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs; > 180 triple-negative patients) to directly assess the prognostic value of the "Reverse Warburg Effect." MCT4 expression is a functional marker of hypoxia, oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, and L-lactate efflux. Remarkably, high stromal MCT4 levels (score = 2) were specifically associated with decreased overall survival (< 18\% survival at 10 y post-diagnosis). In contrast, patients with absent stromal MCT4 expression (score = 0), had 10-y survival rates of ~97\% (p-value < 10 (-32) ). High stromal levels of MCT4 were strictly correlated with a loss of stromal Cav-1 (p-value < 10 (-14) ), a known marker of early tumor recurrence and metastasis. In fact, the combined use of stromal Cav-1 and stromal MCT4 allowed us to more precisely identify high-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients, consistent with the goal of individualized risk-assessment and personalized cancer treatment. However, epithelial MCT4 staining had no prognostic value, indicating that the "conventional" Warburg effect does not predict clinical outcome. Thus, the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer is a key determinant of poor overall patient survival. As MCT4 is a druggable-target, MCT4 inhibitors should be developed for the treatment of aggressive breast cancers, and possibly other types of human cancers. Similarly, we discuss how stromal MCT4 could be used as a biomarker for identifying high-risk cancer patients that could likely benefit from treatment with FDA-approved drugs or existing MCT-inhibitors (such as, AR-C155858, AR-C117977, and AZD-3965).},

Supervised learning methods, which include regression-based methods (e.g., generalized linear models, logic regression, and regularized regression) and tree-based methods (e.g., decision trees and random forests), were used for variable selection (selecting genetic and clinical features most associated or predictive of outcome) and prediction (developing models using common and rare genetic variants to accurately predict outcome), with the outcome being case-control status or quantitative trait value. We include a discussion of cross-validation for model selection and assessment, and a description of available software resources for these methods.},

METHODS: We used data on US adults with arthritis, ages ≥40 years, participating in the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Suicidal ideation was assessed by item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and comorbid conditions were examined as potential correlates. Depression was measured by the PHQ-8 score (range 1-24). We used random forests to identify subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation. To determine if any correlates were unique to arthritis, we compared results to those for persons with diabetes mellitus and cancer.
RESULTS: The prevalence ± SEM of suicidal ideation was 5.6\% ± 0.8\% among persons with arthritis and 2.4\% ± 0.4\% among those without. The most important correlates for suicidal ideation in adults with arthritis were depression, anxiety, duration of arthritis, age, income:poverty ratio, number of close friends, pain, alcohol, excessive daytime sleepiness, and comorbidities. Eleven of the 16 most important contributors for suicidal ideation among adults with arthritis were also important for people with diabetes mellitus and cancer. Among persons with arthritis, subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation were those with a PHQ-8 score between 18 and 24 and less than 4.5 years of arthritis (96.5\%), and those with a PHQ-8 score between 7 and 17, ≥1.24 days of binges/month, and either an income of ≥$45,000/year (85.4\%) or an income of <$45,000/year and >3 comorbidities (70.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Depression, short duration of arthritis, binge drinking, income, and >3 comorbidities identified subgroups of adults with arthritis at greatest risk for suicidal ideation.},

  abstract = {The expression of protein phosphatase 32 (PP32, ANP32A) is low in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancers and is linked to the levels of HuR (ELAV1), a predictive marker for gemcitabine response. In pancreatic cancer cells, exogenous overexpression of pp32 inhibited cell growth, supporting its long-recognized role as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. In chemotherapeutic sensitivity screening assays, cells overexpressing pp32 were selectively resistant to the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and cytarabine (ARA-C), but were sensitized to 5-fluorouracil; conversely, silencing pp32 in pancreatic cancer cells enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity. The cytoplasmic levels of pp32 increased after cancer cells are treated with certain stressors, including gemcitabine. pp32 overexpression reduced the association of HuR with the mRNA encoding the gemcitabine-metabolizing enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), causing a significant reduction in dCK protein levels. Similarly, ectopic pp32 expression caused a reduction in HuR binding of mRNAs encoding tumor-promoting proteins (e.g., VEGF and HuR), while silencing pp32 dramatically enhanced the binding of these mRNA targets. Low pp32 nuclear expression correlated with high-grade tumors and the presence of lymph node metastasis, as compared to patients' tumors with high nuclear pp32 expression. Although pp32 expression levels did not enhance the predictive power of cytoplasmic HuR status, nuclear pp32 levels and cytoplasmic HuR levels associated significantly in patient samples. Thus, we provide novel evidence that the tumor suppressor function of pp32 can be attributed to its ability to disrupt HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding key proteins for cancer cell survival and drug efficacy.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the standard treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recently discovered histone methyltransferase termed enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) was found to be overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Silencing of E-cadherin was proposed as a mechanism by which enhancer of zeste homologue 2 mediates tumor aggressiveness, and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 depletion has been found to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. In this study, we correlated enhancer of zeste homologue 2 with E-cadherin expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and evaluated response to gemcitabine in relation to enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression in tumor cells. Fifty-four pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 13 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and 6 chronic pancreatitis cases were stained with antibodies against enhancer of zeste homologue 2 and E-cadherin. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 staining was scored from 1 to 4+ and classified as either low (1-2+ in <25\% of tumor nuclei) or high (3-4+ in >25\% of tumor nuclei). E-cadherin expression was scored on membrane positivity as follows: 0 (0\%-10\%), 1 (10\%-25\%), 2 (25\%-75\%), and 3 (>75\%). High enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma was significantly associated with decreased E-cadherin expression and more aggressive disease. There was significantly longer survival in gemcitabine-treated patients with low versus high enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression. High enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression was detected in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with moderate to severe dysplasia, but not in chronic pancreatitis. Our study suggests that E-cadherin down-regulation may lead to enhancer of zeste homologue 2-mediated invasion and metastasis.},

A cohort of 85 TN breast cancer patients was available, with the necessary annotation and nearly 12 years of follow-up data. Our primary outcome of interest in this study was overall survival. Interestingly, TN patients with high-levels of stromal Cav-1 had a good clinical outcome, with >50\% of the patients remaining alive during the follow-up period. In contrast, the median survival for TN patients with moderate stromal Cav-1 staining was 33.5 months. Similarly, the median survival for TN patients with absent stromal Cav-1 staining was 25.7 months. A comparison of 5-year survival rates yields a similar pattern. TN patients with high stromal Cav-1 had a good 5-year survival rate, with 75.5\% of the patients remaining alive. In contrast, TN patients with moderate or absent stromal Cav-1 levels had progressively worse 5-year survival rates, with 40 and 9.4\% of the patients remaining alive. In contrast, in a parallel analysis, the levels of tumor epithelial Cav-1 had no prognostic significance. As such, the prognostic value of Cav-1 immunostaining in TN breast cancer patients is compartment-specific, and selective for an absence of Cav-1 staining in the stromal fibroblast compartment. A recursive-partitioning algorithm was used to assess which factors are most predictive of overall survival in TN breast cancer patients. In this analysis, we included tumor size, histologic grade, whether the patient received surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, CK5/6, EGFR, p53 and Ki67 status, as well as the stromal Cav-1 score. This analysis indicated that stromal loss of Cav-1 expression was the most important prognostic factor for overall survival in TN breast cancer. Virtually identical results were obtained with CK5/6 (+) and/or EGFR (+) TN breast cancer cases, demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 is also a strong prognostic factor for basal-like breast cancers. Our current findings may have important implications for the close monitoring and treatment stratification of TN and basal-like breast cancer patients.},

Active Stat5 promoted migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and induced rearrangement of the microtubule network. Active Stat5 expression was associated with decreased cell surface E-cadherin levels, while heterotypic adhesion of prostate cancer cells to endothelial cells was stimulated by active Stat5. Activation of Stat5 and Stat5-induced binding of prostate cancer cells to endothelial cells were decreased by inhibition of Src but not of Jak2. Gene expression profiling indicated that 21\% of Stat5-regulated genes in prostate cancer cells were related to metastases, while 7.9\% were related to proliferation and 3.9\% to apoptosis.

We recently showed that Stat3 promotes metastatic behavior of human prostate cancer cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo experimental metastases model. In this work, we compare side-by-side Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in the promotion of prostate cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and induction of metastatic colonization in vivo. Inhibition of Stat5a/b induced massive death of prostate cancer cells in culture and reduced both subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumor growth, whereas Stat3 had a predominant role over Stat5a/b in promoting metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo in nude mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential biological effects induced by these two transcription factors involve largely different sets of genes regulated by Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in human prostate cancer model systems. Of the two Stat5 homologs, Stat5b was more important for supporting growth of prostate cancer cells than Stat5a.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). It functions as a tumor suppressor; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and promotes tumorigenesis. We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on intestinal cell proliferation, metabolism, signaling, and tumorigenesis in mice.
METHODS: Intestinal cell proliferation and metabolism were examined in Gucy2c(-/-) and colon cancer cells by microscopy, immunoblot, and functional analyses. Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) regulation and signaling were examined, and the role of AKT in GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice.
RESULTS: The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-) mice; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation, increased glycolysis, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, which was reversed by oral administration of cGMP. Conversely, activating guanylyl cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression, decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation, reduced glycolysis, and increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. AKT signaling pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice, associated with increased AKT phosphorylation. Disruption of AKT activity, pharmacologically or genetically, reduced DNA synthesis, proliferation, and glycolysis, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice, but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: GUCY2C is a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation and metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells by inactivating AKT signaling. This receptor and its ligands, which are paracrine hormones, might be novel candidates for anticolorectal cancer therapy.},

An initial cohort of 78 DCIS patients with follow-up data was examined. As ER-positivity was associated with recurrence, we focused our analysis on this subset of 56 patients. In this group, we observed that DCIS progressed to invasive breast cancer in approximately 14\% of the patient population (8/56), in accordance with an expected progression rate of 12-15\%. Nearly ninety percent of DCIS patients (7/8) that underwent recurrence to invasive breast cancer had reduced or absent levels of stromal Cav-1. Remarkably, an absence of stromal Cav-1 (score = 0) was specifically associated with early disease progression to invasive breast cancer, with reduced time to recurrence and higher recurrence rate. All DCIS patients with an absence of stromal Cav-1 underwent some form of recurrence (5/5) and the majority (4/5) underwent progression to invasive breast cancer. This represents an overall cumulative incidence rate of 100\% for recurrence and 80\% for progression. An absence of stromal Cav-1 in DCIS lesions was also specifically associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Conversely, ninety-seven percent of ER(+) DCIS patients (35/36) with high levels of stromal Cav-1 (score = 2) did not show any invasive recurrence over the duration of follow-up (4-208 mo), and 89\% of such patients are estimated to remain free of invasive recurrence, even after 15 y. Thus, determination of stromal Cav-1 levels may be a useful new biomarker for guiding the treatment of ER(+) DCIS patients.},

  abstract = {RNA-binding protein HuR binds U- or AU-rich sequences in the 3'-untranslated regions of target mRNAs, stabilizing them and/or modulating their translation. Given the links of HuR with cancer, we studied the consequences of modulating HuR levels in pancreatic cancer cells. HuR-overexpressing cancer cells, in some instances, are roughly up to 30-fold more sensitive to treatment with gemcitabine, the main chemotherapeutic component of treatment regimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), compared with control cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, HuR associates with deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mRNA, which encodes the enzyme that metabolizes and thereby activates gemcitabine. Gemcitabine exposure to pancreatic cancer cells enriches the association between HuR and dCK mRNA and increases cytoplasmic HuR levels. Accordingly, HuR overexpression elevates, whereas HuR silencing reduces, dCK protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells. In a clinical correlate study of gemcitabine treatment, we found a 7-fold increase in risk of mortality in PDA patients with low cytoplasmic HuR levels compared with patients with high HuR levels, after adjusting for other treatments and demographic variables. These data support the notion that HuR is a key mediator of gemcitabine efficacy in cancer cells, at least in part through its ability to regulate dCK levels posttranscriptionally. We propose that HuR levels in PDA modulate the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, thus serving as a marker of the clinical utility of this common chemotherapeutic agent and a potential target for intervention in pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {Here, we discuss recent evidence that an absence of stromal Cav-1 expression in human breast cancers is a powerful single independent predictor of early disease recurrence, metastasis and poor clinical outcome. These findings have now been validated in two independent patient populations. Importantly, the predictive value of stromal Cav-1 is independent of epithelial marker status, making stromal Cav-1 a new "universal" or "widely-applicable" breast cancer prognostic marker. We propose based on the expression of stromal Cav-1, that breast cancer patients could be stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups. High-risk patients showing an absence of stromal Cav-1 should be offered more aggressive therapies, such as anti-angiogenic approaches, in addition to the standard therapy regimens. Mechanistically, loss of stromal Cav-1 is a surrogate biomarker for increased cell cycle progression, growth factor secretion, "stemness", and angiogenic potential in the tumor microenvironment. Since almost all cancers develop within the context of a stromal microenvironment, this new stromal classification system may be broadly applicable to other epithelial and non-epithelial cancer subtypes, as well as "pre-malignant" lesions (carcinoma in situ).},

  abstract = {Previously, we showed that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is down-regulated in human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 occurs in the breast tumor stroma in vivo. Here, we immunostained a well-annotated breast cancer tissue microarray with antibodies against Cav-1 and scored its stromal expression. An absence of stromal Cav-1 was associated with early disease recurrence, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis, resulting in a 3.6-fold reduction in progression-free survival. When tamoxifen-treated patients were selected, an absence of stromal Cav-1 was a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome, suggestive of tamoxifen resistance. Interestingly, in lymph node-positive patients, an absence of stromal Cav-1 predicted an 11.5-fold reduction in 5-year progression-free survival. Clinical outcomes among patients positive for HER2, and patients triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, were also strictly dependent on stromal Cav-1 levels. When our results were adjusted for tumor and nodal staging, an absence of stromal Cav-1 remained an independent predictor of poor outcome. Thus, stromal Cav-1 expression can be used to stratify human breast cancer patients into low-risk and high-risk groups, and to predict their risk of early disease recurrence at diagnosis. Based on related mechanistic studies, we suggest that breast cancer patients lacking stromal Cav-1 might benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy in addition to standard regimens. We conclude that Cav-1 functions as a tumor suppressor in the stromal microenvironment.},

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 202 patients who elected observation primarily. Data collection included presenting symptoms, symptom progression, tumor size, audiologic measures, and global clinical outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 16 years (mean, 2.48 yr). Nineteen patients (9.4\%) in the study group failed. Disequilibrium as a presenting symptom appeared more often in patients who failed observation (58\% versus 32\%; p = 0.039), as did new-onset disequilibrium. Presenting tumor size differed for patients who failed conservative management, with a mean of 14.0 versus 8.4 mm (p = 0.0006). Neurotologic complications compared favorably to those treated with primary surgery or radiotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with subjective disequilibrium at presentation and subjective disequilibrium developed during observation may be more likely to fail conservative management. Increased tumor size at presentation also may indicate the same, although no threshold could be achieved.},

  abstract = {Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mutations, such as P132L, are associated with ER-positive human breast cancers. However, no immunohistochemical methods have yet been described to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations in human breast cancer. Since the P132L mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion and causes the mis-localization of Cav-1 in cultured cells in vitro, we hypothesized that of patients carrying this mutation would show a similar Cav-1 staining pattern in vivo. Indeed, while performing histological analysis of Cav-1 immunostaining on human breast cancer samples, we noted the emergence of two distinct epithelial staining patterns: (1) punctate peri-nuclear "Golgi-like" localization; or (2) diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The punctate peri-nuclear staining pattern was associated with ER-alpha positivity and was present mainly in well-differentiated samples. In striking contrast, the diffuse staining pattern was present in poorly differentiated samples, and was not associated with ER-status. DNA sequence analysis revealed that only well-differentiated samples with a punctate staining pattern harbored the Cav-1 P132L mutation. Thus, immunostaining of Cav-1 can be used as a first step to stratify human breast cancer patients and to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations. As such, the punctate Cav-1 immunostaining pattern can now be used as a screening tool to select patients for Cav-1 mutational analysis.},

Accurate frozen sections will spare those patients with node metastasis from a second procedure to complete the axillary dissection. We examined our own experience with intraoperative examination of SN.
STUDY DESIGN: Between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006, we performed 236 sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures that were read as "frozen-section-negative." An additional 47 sentinel lymph node biopsy patients were frozen-section-positive for metastatic disease and underwent immediate completion axillary dissection. At least 1 SN was found in all 283 women (100\%). The number of patients with false-negative frozen sections was tallied; patient data were reviewed for a number of variables to see which factors might be associated with a false-negative result.
RESULTS: Eleven patients had positive nodes on subsequent examination of the formalin-fixed, hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides; the false-negative rate of intraoperative frozen section was 4.7\%. The sensitivity of the negative frozen section was > 95\%. The following variables were compared for significance: pathologist, nuclear grade, histologic grade, margins, lymphovascular invasion, tumor type (ductal versus lobular), and estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor values. The only significant variables were lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.019) and presence of in situ ductal carcinoma (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the value of intraoperative examination of SN: > 95\% sensitivity. Presence of in situ ductal carcinoma or lymphovascular invasion makes these tumors more likely than others to have micrometastases to SN overlooked.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that afflicts over 35,000 Americans every year. Since therapeutic options are limited, understanding the molecular aspects of this disease is critical for moving towards targeted treatment of this aggressive form of cancer. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are two proteins that have been shown to be dysregulated in a number of cancers. Functionally these proteins have been shown to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis. We thus surveyed the expression of both these critical proteins in a series of pancreatic precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PanIN) and pancreatic cancers. Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated predominantly with clinical characteristics, such as histologic grade and advanced tumor stage (e.g., high Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated with poor differentiation status) and a significant survival advantage was found in patients with low co-expressing FASN and Cav-1 tumors. Cav-1 and FASN expression was absent in PanIN lesions and the normal ducts and acini. Of note, Cav-1 expression was detected in the fibroblasts of the desmoplastic pancreatic cancer stroma, but not in stromal cells of the normal pancreas. Mechanistically, these data support the notion that these proteins are co-regulated either directly or indirectly by another factor. Importantly, the co-expression of these proteins significantly correlates with clinical features and survival status of pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, Cav-1 and FASN may functionally cooperate in the process of pancreatic tumorigenesis, and as such, may be good candidate prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90\% of lung cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have remained obscure.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically validated smoking information. ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p<0.001 and fold-change >1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p<0.001) and TTK (p = 0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers.},

An attractive approach is gene therapy; however, the clinical barrier has yet to be broken because of several issues, including the lack of an ideal vector supporting safe and long-term myocardial transgene expression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that the use of a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV6) vector containing a novel cardiac-selective enhancer/promoter element can direct stable cardiac expression of a therapeutic transgene, the calcium (Ca2+)-sensing S100A1, in a rat model of heart failure. The chronic heart failure-rescuing properties of myocardial S100A1 expression, the result of improved sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling, included improved contractile function and left ventricular remodeling. Adding to the clinical relevance, long-term S100A1 therapy had unique and additive beneficial effects over beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, a current pharmacological heart failure treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that stable increased expression of S100A1 in the failing heart can be used for long-term reversal of LV dysfunction and remodeling. Thus, long-term, cardiac-targeted rAAV6-S100A1 gene therapy may be of potential clinical utility in human heart failure.},

METHODS: The authors used a novel web-based format to compare assessments of 77 images demonstrating a range of classical and borderline cytologic changes by a self-selected group of United States cytotechnologists (n = 216) and pathologists (n = 185).
RESULTS: Participants were highly experienced, with 71.2\% of cytotechnologists and 53.0\% of pathologists reporting >10 years of practice. The mean percentage of exact agreement with the panel was slightly though significantly higher for cytotechnologists (57.0\%) compared with pathologists (53.4\%), adjusted for experience (P = .004); cervical cytology percentage effort (P = .0005); or cervical accession volume (P = .0002). Compared with the TBS panel, exact agreement was achieved for 55.1\% of image ratings compared with 82.3\% agreement at the level of Negative vs non-Negative for images with a single-panel interpretation. Agreement with the panel was highest for images classified as Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion and lowest for Atypical Squamous Cells qualified as either of Undetermined Significance or Cannot Exclude a High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion. Reviewers were less sensitive in identifying high-grade glandular lesions than they were in identifying high-grade squamous lesions at any threshold (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic appearances of images were more important determinants than participants' academic or professional degrees with regard to interobserver reproducibility in classifying cervical cytology images. Experienced cytotechnologists and pathologists performed similarly. Participants achieved higher sensitivity for identifying high-grade squamous lesions than they did for high-grade glandular lesions. These findings demonstrated that web-based studies may be useful in assessing interobserver agreement in classifying images.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic literature is replete with conceptual discussions about causal inference, but little is known about how the causal criteria are applied in public health practice. The criteria for causal inference in use today by epidemiologists have been shaped substantially by their use over time in reports of the U.S. Surgeon General on Smoking and Health.
METHODS: We reviewed two classic reports on smoking and health from expert committees convened by the US Surgeon General, in 1964 and 1982, in order to evaluate and contrast how the committees applied causal criteria to the available evidence for the different cancer sites at different time periods. We focus on the evidence for four cancer sites in particular that received detailed reviews in the reports: lung, larynx, esophagus and bladder.
RESULTS: We found that strength of association and coherence (especially dose-response, biological plausibility and epidemiologic sense) appeared to carry the most weight; consistency carried less weight, and temporality and specificity were apparently not applied at all in some cases. No causal claim was made for associations with a summary odds ratio of less than 3.0.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the causal criteria as described in textbooks and the Surgeon General reports can have variable interpretations and applications in practice. While the authors of these reports may have considered evidential factors that they did not explicitly cite, such lack of transparency of methods undermines the purpose of the causal criteria to promote objective, evidence-based decision making. Further empirical study and critical examination of the process by which causal conclusions are reached can play an important role in advancing the practice of epidemiology by helping public health scientists to better understand the practice of causal inference.},

The hepatocellular carcinoma cases had higher median plasma concentrations of 249(Ser) (2,800 copies/mL; interquartile range: 500-11,000) compared with either cirrhotic (500 copies/mL; interquartile range: 500-2,600) or control subjects (500 copies/mL; interquartile range: 500-2,000; P < 0.05).

To evaluate the validity of assessing gene expression in cervical tissues acquired in a clinical setting, we investigated whether standard procedures, namely the application of acetic acid and/or Lugol's iodine, employed for the visualization of colposcopically directed biopsies, altered patterns in oligonucleotide (oligo) arrays. We compared microarray profiles from six women, each with three adjacent tissue samples removed from benign hysterectomy specimens and treated as follows: immediately frozen, acetic acid application only, acetic acid, and Lugol's iodine. Of the 22,464 original spots on the microarray, 4,850 spots were expressed at detectable levels for further evaluation upon data normalization and filtration. For each spot, the difference between topical applications was computed, and P values were calculated using a bivariate T2 test. Upon adjustment for multiple comparisons using both the Holm's and Hochberg's procedures as well as the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yeuketili [BY]), we failed to identify genes differentially expressed and conclude that standard precolposcopic procedures do not substantially affect the overall gene expression patterns in the normal cervix.},
