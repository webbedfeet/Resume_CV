# Summary

I am an experienced statistician and data scientist interested in
multidisciplinary collaborations to understand and solve problems using modern
data analytic tools and techniques. I am also interested in the mentoring,
education and training of the next generation of data scientists.

# Recent Teaching

I am a [Carpentries](https://www.carpentries.org)-certified instructor with extensive experience 
teaching data science using R and Python to a wide variety of corporate,
government and academic audiences. My classes have included programming neophytes as well as 
experienced analysts looking to enhance their skills. Workshop and training clients include Freddie Mac, the State Department and Brookings Institute. I regular teach R classes at NIH.
