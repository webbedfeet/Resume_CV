	Abstract = {Racial and ethnic minorities, particularly blacks, survive
		longer on maintenance dialysis than whites. Minorities are also less
			likely to discontinue dialysis, which affects relative survival.
			Both differences have been attributed by some clinicians to better
			health among minorities on dialysis. To test if health differences
			explain racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation,
		the authors compared the frequency of dialysis discontinuation among
			racial and ethnic groups after hospitalization for one of four
			serious medical conditions. Despite hospitalization for the same
			condition, racial and ethnic minorities were less likely than
			whites to discontinue dialysis. Using a simulation that accounted
			for differences in dialysis discontinuation substantially reduced
				the survival advantage of racial and ethnic minorities. The
					study suggests that racial and ethnic differences in
					survival were largely determined by differential
					discontinuation of dialysis.Background Racial and ethnic
					minorities on dialysis survive longer than whites, and are
					less likely to discontinue dialysis. Both differences have
					been attributed by some clinicians to better health among
					minorities on dialysis.Methods To test if racial and ethnic
					differences in dialysis discontinuation reflected better
					health, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of
					survival and dialysis discontinuation among patients on
					maintenance dialysis in the US Renal Data System after
					hospitalization for either stroke (n=60,734), lung cancer
					(n=4100), dementia (n=40,084), or failure to thrive
					(n=42,950) between 2003 and 2014. We examined the frequency
					of discontinuation of dialysis and used simulations to
					estimate survival in minorities relative to whites if
					minorities had the same pattern of dialysis discontinuation
					as whites.Results Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had
					substantially lower frequencies of dialysis discontinuation
					than whites in each hospitalization cohort. Observed risks
					of mortality were also lower for blacks, Hispanics, and
					Asians. In simulations that assigned discontinuation
					patterns similar to those found among whites across racial
					and ethnic groups, differences in survival were markedly
					attenuated and hazard ratios approached 1.0. Survival and
					dialysis discontinuation frequencies among American Indians
					and Alaska Natives were close to those of
					whites.Conclusions Racial and ethnic differences in
					dialysis discontinuation were present among patients
					hospitalized with similar health events. Among these
					patients, survival differences between racial and ethnic
					minorities and whites were largely attributable to
					differences in the frequency of discontinuation of
					dialysis.},

@article{Jha:2018b,
	Abstract = {Melorheostosis (MEL) is a rare disease of high bone mass with
		patchy skeletal distribution affecting the long bones. We recently
			reported somatic mosaic mutations in MAP2K1 in 8 of 15 patients
			with the disease. The unique anatomic distribution of
			melorheostosis is of great interest. The disease remains limited to
			medial or lateral side of the extremity with proximo-distal
			progression. This pattern of distribution has historically been
			attributed to sclerotomes (area of bone which is innervated by a
			single spinal nerve level). In a further analysis of our
			study on MEL, 30 recruited patients underwent whole body CT scans
			to characterize the anatomic distribution of the disease. Two
			radiologists independently reviewed these scans and compared it to
			the proposed map of sclerotomes. We found that the disease
			distribution conformed to the distribution of a single sclerotome
			in only 5 patients (17\%). In another 12 patients, the lesions
			spanned parts of contiguous sclerotomes but did not involve the
			entire extent of the sclerotomes. Our findings raise concerns about
			the sclerotomal hypothesis being the definitive explanation for the
			pattern of anatomic distribution in MEL. We believe that the
			disease distribution can be explained by clonal proliferation of a
			mutated skeletal progenitor cell along the limb axis. Studies in
			mice models on clonal proliferation in limb buds mimic the patterns
			seen in melorheostosis. We also support this hypothesis by the
			dorso-ventral confinement of melorheostotic lesion in a patient
			with low allele frequency of MAP2K1-positive osteoblasts and low
			skeletal burden of the disease. This suggests that the mutation
			occurred after the formation of dorso-ventral plane. Further
			studies on limb development are needed to better understand the
			etiology, pathophysiology and pattern of disease distribution in
			all patients with MEL. },

@article{Wang:2018,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 6 tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (TNFi) in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.
ETHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials of TNFi in patients with active AS. We included trials that reported efficacy at 10 to 14 weeks (12-week analysis) and at 24 to 30 weeks (24-week analysis). We used Bayesian network metaanalysis (NMA) to compare their relative efficacy to improve the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level.
RESULTS: We included 20 trials of 6 TNFi, with 43 treatment arms and 3220 participants. All TNFi were significantly better than placebo in reducing BASDAI and BASFI at 12 weeks and 24 weeks; all but certolizumab pegol (CZP) were statistically better than placebo in reducing CRP at 12 weeks; all but CZP and infliximab-dyyb (IFX biosimilar) were significantly better than placebo in reducing CRP at 24 weeks. IFX was superior to the other TNFi in decreasing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but not at 24 weeks. Excluding 1 open-label trial, there were no differences among TNFi.
CONCLUSION: Based on this NMA of clinical trials, IFX was superior to other TNFi in reducing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but sensitive to inclusion of an open-label trial, and its efficacy was diminished at 24 weeks. The analysis was limited by few direct comparison trials. Further study of relative safety and longterm effectiveness will help inform the choice of TNFi in treating active AS.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional limitations in ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
  may be due to peripheral joint or axial involvement. To determine if the Bath
  Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), an axial-focused measure,
  can detect limitations related to peripheral joint involvement equally as
  well as the Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for the
  spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), a peripheral arthritis-focused measure, and
  vice versa, we compared associations of each questionnaire with spinal and
  hip range of motion, peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis in patients with
  AS. METHODS: We examined patients every 4-6 months in this prospective
  longitudinal study. We used mixed linear models to analyze the associations
  between 10 physical examination measures and the BASFI and HAQ-S. RESULTS: We
  studied 411 patients for a median of 1.5 years (median 3 visits). In
  multivariate analyses, cervical rotation, chest expansion, lateral
  thoracolumbar flexion, hip motion, tender joint count, and tender enthesis
  count were equally strongly associated with the BASFI and HAQ-S. Peripheral
  joint swelling was more strongly associated with the HAQ-S. Individual items
  of the BASFI were more likely than items of the HAQ-S to be associated with
  unrelated physical examination measures (e.g., the association between
  difficulty rising from a chair and cervical rotation), which may have
  diminished the axial/peripheral distinction for the BASFI. CONCLUSION: The
  BASFI and HAQ-S had similar associations with impairments in axial measures,
  while the HAQ-S had stronger associations with the number of swollen
  peripheral joints. The HAQ-S should be considered for use in studies focused
  on spondyloarthritis with peripheral joint involvement.},

@article{Costantino2009,
	Abstract = {RNA-binding protein HuR binds U- or AU-rich sequences in the
  3'-untranslated regions of target mRNAs, stabilizing them and/or modulating
  their translation. Given the links of HuR with cancer, we studied the
  consequences of modulating HuR levels in pancreatic cancer cells.
  HuR-overexpressing cancer cells, in some instances, are roughly up to 30-fold
  more sensitive to treatment with gemcitabine, the main chemotherapeutic
  component of treatment regimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA),
  compared with control cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, HuR associates with
  deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mRNA, which encodes the enzyme that metabolizes
  and thereby activates gemcitabine. Gemcitabine exposure to pancreatic cancer
  cells enriches the association between HuR and dCK mRNA and increases
  cytoplasmic HuR levels. Accordingly, HuR overexpression elevates, whereas HuR
  silencing reduces, dCK protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells. In a
  clinical correlate study of gemcitabine treatment, we found a 7-fold increase
  in risk of mortality in PDA patients with low cytoplasmic HuR levels compared
  with patients with high HuR levels, after adjusting for other treatments and
  demographic variables. These data support the notion that HuR is a key
  mediator of gemcitabine efficacy in cancer cells, at least in part through
  its ability to regulate dCK levels posttranscriptionally. We propose that HuR
  levels in PDA modulate the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, thus serving
  as a marker of the clinical utility of this common chemotherapeutic agent and
  a potential target for intervention in pancreatic cancer.},

  regression and machine learning methods were used to address different
  problems inherent in the analyses of these data, which are high-dimension,
  low-sample-size data typical of many genetic association studies.
  Unsupervised methods, such as cluster analysis, were used for data
  segmentation and, subset selection. Supervised learning methods, which
  include regression-based methods (e.g., generalized linear models, logic
  regression, and regularized regression) and tree-based methods (e.g.,
  decision trees and random forests), were used for variable selection
  (selecting genetic and clinical features most associated or predictive of
  outcome) and prediction (developing models using common and rare genetic
  variants to accurately predict outcome), with the outcome being case-control
  status or quantitative trait value. We include a discussion of
  cross-validation for model selection and assessment, and a description of
  available software resources for these methods.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Logistic regression has been the de facto, and often the only, model used in the description and analysis of relationships between a binary outcome and observed features. It is widely used to obtain the conditional probabilities of the outcome given predictors, as well as predictor effect size estimates using conditional odds ratios. RESULTS: We show how statistical learning machines for binary outcomes, provably consistent for the nonparametric regression problem, can be used to provide both consistent conditional probability estimation and conditional effect size estimates. Effect size estimates from learning machines leverage our understanding of counterfactual arguments central to the interpretation of such estimates. We show that, if the data generating model is logistic, we can recover accurate probability predictions and effect size estimates with nearly the same efficiency as a correct logistic model, both for main effects and interactions. We also propose a method using learning machines to scan for possible interaction effects quickly and efficiently. Simulations using random forest probability machines are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The models we propose make no assumptions about the data structure, and capture the patterns in the data by just specifying the predictors involved and not any particular model structure. So they do not run the same risks of model mis-specification and the resultant estimation biases as a logistic model. This methodology, which we call a "risk machine", will share properties from the statistical machine that it is derived from.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Among children <13 years of age with persistent
  psychosis and contemporaneous decline in functioning, it is often difficult
  to determine if the diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia (COS) is
  warranted. Despite decades of experience, we have up to a 44\% false positive
  screening diagnosis rate among patients identified as having probable or
  possible COS; final diagnoses are made following inpatient hospitalization
  and medication washout. Because our lengthy medication-free observation is
  not feasible in clinical practice, we constructed diagnostic classifiers
  using screening data to assist clinicians practicing in the community or
  academic centers. METHODS: We used cross-validation, logistic regression,
  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and random forest to
  determine the best algorithm for classifying COS (n=85) versus histories of
  psychosis and impaired functioning in children and adolescents who, at
  screening, were considered likely to have COS, but who did not meet
  diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia after medication washout and inpatient
  observation (n=53). We used demographics, clinical history measures,
  intelligence quotient (IQ) and screening rating scales, and number of typical
  and atypical antipsychotic medications as our predictors. RESULTS: Logistic
  regression models using nine, four, and two predictors performed well with
  positive predictive values>90\%, overall accuracy>77\%, and areas under the
  curve (AUCs)>86\%. CONCLUSIONS: COS can be distinguished from alternate
  disorders with psychosis in children and adolescents; greater levels of
  positive and negative symptoms and lower levels of depression combine to make
  COS more likely. We include a worksheet so that clinicians in the community
  and academic centers can predict the probability that a young patient may be
  schizophrenic, using only two ratings.},

	Abstract = {Standard analysis methods for genome wide association studies
  (GWAS) are not robust to complex disease models, such as interactions between
  variables with small main effects. These types of effects likely contribute
  to the heritability of complex human traits. Machine learning methods that
  are capable of identifying interactions, such as Random Forests (RF), are an
  alternative analysis approach. One caveat to RF is that there is no
  standardized method of selecting variables so that false positives are
  reduced while retaining adequate power. To this end, we have developed a
  novel variable selection method called relative recurrency variable
  importance metric (r2VIM). This method incorporates recurrency and variance
  estimation to assist in optimal threshold selection. For this study, we
  specifically address how this method performs in data with almost completely
  epistatic effects (i.e. no marginal effects). Our results show that with
  appropriate parameter settings, r2VIM can identify interaction effects when
  the marginal effects are virtually nonexistent. It also outperforms logistic
  regression, which has essentially no power under this type of model when the

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90\% of lung
	  cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by
		  smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have
		  remained obscure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed gene
		  expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh
		  frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung
		  tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically
		  validated smoking information. ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential
		  confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment
		  Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene
		  selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and
		  non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression
		  signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes,
	  particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2,
			  TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated
		  both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor
		  tissue from non-tumor tissue (p<0.001 and fold-change >1.5, for each
				  comparison), consistent with an important role for this
		  pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes
		  persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p<0.001) and TTK
		  (p = 0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also
		  associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung
		  adenocarcinoma in smokers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work
		  provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung
		  neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved
		  in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival.
		  These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the
  paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts
  guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). It
  functions as a tumor suppressor; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and
  promotes tumorigenesis. We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on
  intestinal cell proliferation, metabolism, signaling, and tumorigenesis in
  mice. METHODS: Intestinal cell proliferation and metabolism were examined in
  Gucy2c(-/-) and colon cancer cells by microscopy, immunoblot, and functional
  analyses. Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine
  cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
  homolog (AKT) regulation and signaling were examined, and the role of AKT in
  GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice.
  RESULTS: The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-)
  mice; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation,
  increased glycolysis, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, which was
  reversed by oral administration of cGMP. Conversely, activating guanylyl
  cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression,
  decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation, reduced glycolysis, and
  increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. AKT signaling
  pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice, associated with
  increased AKT phosphorylation. Disruption of AKT activity, pharmacologically
  or genetically, reduced DNA synthesis, proliferation, and glycolysis, and
  increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after
  administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type
  mice, but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: GUCY2C is
  a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation and metabolism of intestinal
  epithelial cells by inactivating AKT signaling. This receptor and its
  ligands, which are paracrine hormones, might be novel candidates for
  anticolorectal cancer therapy.},

		  participated in a reliability study in preparation for a clinical
		  trial involving individuals with acute SCI. After a training session
		  on the standards, each examiner evaluated 3 patients for motor, light

		  reevaluated one patient. Interrater reliability was determined using
		  intraclass correlation coefficients (1-way, random effects model).
		  Intrarater reliability was determined using a 2-way random effects
		  model. Repeatability was determined using the method of Bland and
		  Altman. RESULTS: Patients were classified as complete tetraplegia (n
				  = 5), incomplete tetraplegia (n = 5), complete paraplegia (n
					  = 5), and incomplete paraplegia (n = 1). Overall,

	Abstract = {This study examined changes in bereaved parents' mental distress
  following the violent deaths of their 12- to 28-year-old children. A
  community-based sample of 171 bereaved mothers and 90 fathers was recruited
  by a review of medical examiner records. Data were collected 4, 12, and 24
  months post-death. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant
  reductions in 8 of 10 measures of mental distress among mothers and 4 of 10
  for fathers, with the most change for both genders occurring between 4 and 12
  months post-death. During the 2nd year of bereavement, mothers' symptoms
  continued to decline, whereas fathers, who started out with less distress
  than mothers, reported slight increases in 5 of 10 symptom domains.
  Nonetheless, 2 years after the deaths, mothers' mental distress scores were
  up to 5 times higher than those of "typical" U.S. women and fathers' scores
  were up to 4 times higher than "typical" U.S. men. Of the 7 intervening
  variables examined, higher scores on self-esteem and self-efficacy predicted
  lower distress for both mothers and fathers 4, 12, and 24 months post-death.
  Repressive coping was predictive of distress among fathers. It was concluded
  that violent death bereavement has sustained, distressing consequences on
  parents of children who die as a result of accidents, homicides, and

@article{Parascandola2006,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic literature is replete with
  conceptual discussions about causal inference, but little is known about how
  the causal criteria are applied in public health practice. The criteria for
  causal inference in use today by epidemiologists have been shaped
  substantially by their use over time in reports of the U.S. Surgeon General
  on Smoking and Health. METHODS: We reviewed two classic reports on smoking
  and health from expert committees convened by the US Surgeon General, in 1964
  and 1982, in order to evaluate and contrast how the committees applied causal
  criteria to the available evidence for the different cancer sites at
  different time periods. We focus on the evidence for four cancer sites in
  particular that received detailed reviews in the reports: lung, larynx,
  esophagus and bladder. RESULTS: We found that strength of association and
  coherence (especially dose-response, biological plausibility and
  epidemiologic sense) appeared to carry the most weight; consistency carried
  less weight, and temporality and specificity were apparently not applied at
  all in some cases. No causal claim was made for associations with a summary
  odds ratio of less than 3.0. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the causal
  criteria as described in textbooks and the Surgeon General reports can have
  variable interpretations and applications in practice. While the authors of
  these reports may have considered evidential factors that they did not
  explicitly cite, such lack of transparency of methods undermines the purpose
  of the causal criteria to promote objective, evidence-based decision making.
  Further empirical study and critical examination of the process by which
  causal conclusions are reached can play an important role in advancing the
  practice of epidemiology by helping public health scientists to better
	  understand the practice of causal inference.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of heart failure is ever-growing, and
	  it is urgent to develop improved treatments. An attractive approach is
		  gene therapy; however, the clinical barrier has yet to be broken
		  because of several issues, including the lack of an ideal vector
		  supporting safe and long-term myocardial transgene expression.
		  METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that the use of a recombinant
		  adeno-associated viral (rAAV6) vector containing a novel
		  cardiac-selective enhancer/promoter element can direct stable cardiac
		  expression of a therapeutic transgene, the calcium (Ca2+)-sensing
		  S100A1, in a rat model of heart failure. The chronic heart
		  failure-rescuing properties of myocardial S100A1 expression, the
		  result of improved sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling, included
		  improved contractile function and left ventricular remodeling. Adding
		  to the clinical relevance, long-term S100A1 therapy had unique and
		  additive beneficial effects over beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, a
		  current pharmacological heart failure treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These
		  findings demonstrate that stable increased expression of S100A1 in
		  the failing heart can be used for long-term reversal of LV
		  dysfunction and remodeling. Thus, long-term, cardiac-targeted
		  rAAV6-S100A1 gene therapy may be of potential clinical utility in
		  human heart failure.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study determined if time perspective was
  associated with medication adherence among people with hypertension and
  diabetes. METHODS: Using the Health Beliefs Model, we used path analysis to
  test direct and indirect effects of time perspective and health beliefs on
  adherence among 178 people who participated in a community-based survey near
  Washington, D.C. We measured three time perspectives (future, present
  fatalistic, and present hedonistic) with the Zimbardo Time Perspective
  Inventory and medication adherence by self-report. RESULTS: The total model
  demonstrated a good fit (RMSEA=0.17, 90\% CI [0.10, 0.28], p=0.003;
  comparative fit index=0.91). Future time perspective and age showed direct
  effects on increased medication adherence; an increase by a single unit in
  future time perspective was associated with a 0.32 standard deviation
  increase in reported adherence. There were no significant indirect effects of
  time perspective with reported medication adherence through health beliefs.
  CONCLUSION: The findings provide the first evidence that time perspective
  plays an under-recognized role as a psychological motivator in medication
  adherence. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patient counseling for medication adherence
  may be enhanced if clinicians incorporate consideration of the patient's time
  perspective.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The value of frozen sections in the intraoperative
  examination of sentinel nodes (SN) remains controversial. Accurate frozen
  sections will spare those patients with node metastasis from a second
  procedure to complete the axillary dissection. We examined our own experience
  with intraoperative examination of SN. STUDY DESIGN: Between January 1, 2006,
  and December 31, 2006, we performed 236 sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures
  that were read as "frozen-section-negative." An additional 47 sentinel lymph
  node biopsy patients were frozen-section-positive for metastatic disease and
  underwent immediate completion axillary dissection. At least 1 SN was found
  in all 283 women (100\%). The number of patients with false-negative frozen
  sections was tallied; patient data were reviewed for a number of variables to
  see which factors might be associated with a false-negative result. RESULTS:
  Eleven patients had positive nodes on subsequent examination of the
  formalin-fixed, hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides; the false-negative rate
  of intraoperative frozen section was 4.7\%. The sensitivity of the negative
  frozen section was > 95\%. The following variables were compared for
  significance: pathologist, nuclear grade, histologic grade, margins,
  lymphovascular invasion, tumor type (ductal versus lobular), and estrogen
  receptor and progesterone receptor values. The only significant variables
  were lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.019) and presence of in situ ductal
  carcinoma (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the value of
  intraoperative examination of SN: > 95\% sensitivity. Presence of in situ
  ductal carcinoma or lymphovascular invasion makes these tumors more likely

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Bethesda System (TBS) along with its companion
  atlas was updated in 2001 to improve standardization, clarity, and
  reproducibility of cervical cytology reporting. METHODS: The authors used a
  novel web-based format to compare assessments of 77 images demonstrating a
  range of classical and borderline cytologic changes by a self-selected group
  of United States cytotechnologists (n = 216) and pathologists (n = 185).
  RESULTS: Participants were highly experienced, with 71.2\% of
  cytotechnologists and 53.0\% of pathologists reporting >10 years of practice.
  The mean percentage of exact agreement with the panel was slightly though
  significantly higher for cytotechnologists (57.0\%) compared with
  pathologists (53.4\%), adjusted for experience (P = .004); cervical cytology
  percentage effort (P = .0005); or cervical accession volume (P = .0002).
  Compared with the TBS panel, exact agreement was achieved for 55.1\% of image
  ratings compared with 82.3\% agreement at the level of Negative vs
  non-Negative for images with a single-panel interpretation. Agreement with
  the panel was highest for images classified as Low-Grade Squamous
  Intraepithelial Lesion and lowest for Atypical Squamous Cells qualified as
  either of Undetermined Significance or Cannot Exclude a High-Grade Squamous
  Intraepithelial Lesion. Reviewers were less sensitive in identifying
  high-grade glandular lesions than they were in identifying high-grade
  squamous lesions at any threshold (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic
  appearances of images were more important determinants than participants'
  academic or professional degrees with regard to interobserver reproducibility
  in classifying cervical cytology images. Experienced cytotechnologists and
  pathologists performed similarly. Participants achieved higher sensitivity
  for identifying high-grade squamous lesions than they did for high-grade

  METHODS: We used data on US adults with arthritis, ages >/=40 years,
  participating in the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination
  Survey. Suicidal ideation was assessed by item 9 of the Patient Health
  Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and
  comorbid conditions were examined as potential correlates. Depression was
  measured by the PHQ-8 score (range 1-24). We used random forests to identify
  subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation. To determine if any
  correlates were unique to arthritis, we compared results to those for persons
  with diabetes mellitus and cancer. RESULTS: The prevalence +/- SEM of
  suicidal ideation was 5.6\% +/- 0.8\% among persons with arthritis and 2.4\%
  +/- 0.4\% among those without. The most important correlates for suicidal
  ideation in adults with arthritis were depression, anxiety, duration of
  arthritis, age, income:poverty ratio, number of close friends, pain, alcohol,
  excessive daytime sleepiness, and comorbidities. Eleven of the 16 most
  important contributors for suicidal ideation among adults with arthritis were

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of hospitalization for serious
  infections, trends in rates from 1996 to 2011, and in-hospital mortality
  between patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and those without
  SLE in a national sample. METHODS: We analyzed hospitalizations for
  pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and
  opportunistic infections among adults in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We
  compared rates of hospitalization yearly among patients with SLE and the
  general population. We also computed odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital
  mortality. RESULTS: In 1996, the estimated number of hospitalizations for
  pneumonia in patients with SLE was 4,382, followed by sepsis (2,305), skin
  infections (1,422), urinary tract infections (643), and opportunistic
  infections (370). Rates were much higher in patients with SLE than in those
  without SLE, with age-adjusted relative risks ranging from 5.7 (95\%
  confidence interval [95\% CI] 5.5-6.0) for pneumonia to 9.8 (95\% CI
  9.1-10.7) for urinary tract infection in 1996. Risks increased over time, so
  that by 2011, all relative risks exceeded 12.0. Overall risk of in-hospital
  mortality was higher in SLE only for opportunistic infections (adjusted OR
  1.52 [95\% CI 1.12-2.07]). However, in pneumonia and sepsis, mortality risks
  were higher in SLE among those who required mechanical ventilation.
  CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates for serious infections in SLE increased
  substantially between 1996 and 2011, reaching over 12 times higher than in
  patients without SLE in 2011. Reasons for this acceleration are unclear.
  In-hospital mortality was higher among patients with SLE and opportunistic
  infections and those with pneumonia or sepsis who required mechanical
  ventilation.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of
  cancer deaths in the United States. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the
  standard treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recently
  discovered histone methyltransferase termed enhancer of zeste homologue 2
  (EZH2) was found to be overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas including
	  pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Silencing of E-cadherin was proposed as a
		  mechanism by which enhancer of zeste homologue 2 mediates tumor
		  aggressiveness, and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 depletion has been
		  found to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. In this
		  study, we correlated enhancer of zeste homologue 2 with E-cadherin
		  expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and evaluated response to
		  gemcitabine in relation to enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression
		  in tumor cells. Fifty-four pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 13 intraductal
		  papillary mucinous neoplasms, and 6 chronic pancreatitis cases were
		  stained with antibodies against enhancer of zeste homologue 2 and
		  E-cadherin. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 staining was scored from 1
		  to 4+ and classified as either low (1-2+ in <25\% of tumor nuclei) or
		  high (3-4+ in >25\% of tumor nuclei). E-cadherin expression was
		  scored on membrane positivity as follows: 0 (0\%-10\%), 1
		  (10\%-25\%), 2 (25\%-75\%), and 3 (>75\%). High enhancer of zeste
		  homologue 2 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma was significantly
		  associated with decreased E-cadherin expression and more aggressive
		  disease. There was significantly longer survival in
		  gemcitabine-treated patients with low versus high enhancer of zeste
		  homologue 2 expression. High enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression
		  was detected in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with
		  moderate to severe dysplasia, but not in chronic pancreatitis. Our
		  study suggests that E-cadherin down-regulation may lead to enhancer
		  of zeste homologue 2-mediated invasion and metastasis.},

To evaluate the validity of assessing gene expression in cervical tissues acquired in a clinical setting, we investigated whether standard procedures, namely the application of acetic acid and/or Lugol's iodine, employed for the visualization of colposcopically directed biopsies, altered patterns in oligonucleotide (oligo) arrays. We compared microarray profiles from six women, each with three adjacent tissue samples removed from benign hysterectomy specimens and treated as follows: immediately frozen, acetic acid application only, acetic acid, and Lugol's iodine. Of the 22,464 original spots on the microarray, 4,850 spots were expressed at detectable levels for further evaluation upon data normalization and filtration. For each spot, the difference between topical applications was computed, and P values were calculated using a bivariate T2 test. Upon adjustment for multiple comparisons using both the Holm's and Hochberg's procedures as well as the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yeuketili [BY]), we failed to identify genes differentially expressed and conclude that standard precolposcopic procedures do not substantially affect the overall gene expression patterns in the normal cervix.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Medications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may affect
  survival. However, studies often include limited follow-up and do not account
  for selection bias in treatment allocation. Using a large longitudinal
  database, we examined the association between prednisone use and mortality in
  RA, and whether this risk was modified with concomitant disease-modifying
  antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use, after controlling for propensity for
  treatment with prednisone and individual DMARDs. METHODS: In a prospective
  study of 5,626 patients with RA followed for up to 25 years, we determined
  the risk of death associated with prednisone use alone and combined treatment
  of prednisone with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. We used the random forest
  method to generate propensity scores for prednisone use and each DMARD at
  study entry and during follow-up. Mortality risks were estimated using
  multivariate Cox models that included propensity scores. RESULTS: During
  follow-up (median 4.97 years), 666 patients (11.8\%) died. In a multivariate,
  propensity-adjusted model, prednisone use was associated with an increased
  risk of death (HR 2.83 [95\% CI 1.03, 7.76]). However, there was a
  significant interaction between prednisone use and methotrexate use (p=0.03),
  so that risk was attenuated when patients were treated with both medications
  (HR 0.99 [95\% CI 0.18, 5.36]). However, combination treatment also weakened
  the protective association of methotrexate with mortality. Results were
  similar for sulfasalazine. CONCLUSION: Prednisone use was associated with a
  significantly increased risk of mortality in patients with RA. This
  association was mitigated by concomitant DMARD use, but combined treatment
  also negated the previously reported beneficial association of methotrexate
  with survival in RA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis
	  (RA) may affect survival in RA, few studies take into account the
		  propensity for medication use, which may reflect selection bias in
		  treatment allocation in survival models. We undertook this study to
		  examine the relationship between methotrexate (MTX) use and mortality
		  in RA, after controlling for individual propensity scores for MTX
		  use. METHODS: We studied 5,626 RA patients prospectively for 25 years

		  to generate individual propensity scores for MTX use at study entry
		  and during followup in a time-varying manner; these scores were

		  the risk of mortality, and we examined the association of duration of

		  died. MTX use was associated with reduced risk of death (adjusted
				  hazard ratio 0.30 [95\% confidence interval 0.09-1.03]).
		  Selective MTX cessation immediately before death did not account for

	Abstract = {The expression of protein phosphatase 32 (PP32, ANP32A) is low
  in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancers and is linked to the levels of
  HuR (ELAV1), a predictive marker for gemcitabine response. In pancreatic
  cancer cells, exogenous overexpression of pp32 inhibited cell growth,
  supporting its long-recognized role as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic
  cancer. In chemotherapeutic sensitivity screening assays, cells
  overexpressing pp32 were selectively resistant to the nucleoside analogs
  gemcitabine and cytarabine (ARA-C), but were sensitized to 5-fluorouracil;
  conversely, silencing pp32 in pancreatic cancer cells enhanced gemcitabine
  sensitivity. The cytoplasmic levels of pp32 increased after cancer cells are
  treated with certain stressors, including gemcitabine. pp32 overexpression
  reduced the association of HuR with the mRNA encoding the
  gemcitabine-metabolizing enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), causing a
  significant reduction in dCK protein levels. Similarly, ectopic pp32
  expression caused a reduction in HuR binding of mRNAs encoding
  tumor-promoting proteins (e.g., VEGF and HuR), while silencing pp32
  dramatically enhanced the binding of these mRNA targets. Low pp32 nuclear
  expression correlated with high-grade tumors and the presence of lymph node
  metastasis, as compared to patients' tumors with high nuclear pp32
  expression. Although pp32 expression levels did not enhance the predictive
  power of cytoplasmic HuR status, nuclear pp32 levels and cytoplasmic HuR
  levels associated significantly in patient samples. Thus, we provide novel
  evidence that the tumor suppressor function of pp32 can be attributed to its
  ability to disrupt HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding key proteins for
  cancer cell survival and drug efficacy.},

	Abstract = {Here, we discuss recent evidence that an absence of stromal
  Cav-1 expression in human breast cancers is a powerful single independent
  predictor of early disease recurrence, metastasis and poor clinical outcome.
  These findings have now been validated in two independent patient
  populations. Importantly, the predictive value of stromal Cav-1 is
  independent of epithelial marker status, making stromal Cav-1 a new
  "universal" or "widely-applicable" breast cancer prognostic marker. We
  propose based on the expression of stromal Cav-1, that breast cancer patients
  could be stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups. High-risk patients
  showing an absence of stromal Cav-1 should be offered more aggressive
  therapies, such as anti-angiogenic approaches, in addition to the standard
  therapy regimens. Mechanistically, loss of stromal Cav-1 is a surrogate
  biomarker for increased cell cycle progression, growth factor secretion,
  "stemness", and angiogenic potential in the tumor microenvironment. Since
  almost all cancers develop within the context of a stromal microenvironment,
  this new stromal classification system may be broadly applicable to other
  epithelial and non-epithelial cancer subtypes, as well as "pre-malignant"
  lesions (carcinoma in situ).},

	Abstract = {Here, we determined the possible association of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) levels with DCIS recurrence and/or progression to invasive breast cancer. An initial cohort of 78 DCIS patients with follow-up data was examined. As ER-positivity was associated with recurrence, we focused our analysis on this subset of 56 patients. In this group, we observed that DCIS progressed to invasive breast cancer in approximately 14\% of the patient population (8/56), in accordance with an expected progression rate of 12-15\%. Nearly ninety percent of DCIS patients (7/8) that underwent recurrence to invasive breast cancer had reduced or absent levels of stromal Cav-1. Remarkably, an absence of stromal Cav-1 (score = 0) was specifically associated with early disease progression to invasive breast cancer, with reduced time to recurrence and higher recurrence rate. All DCIS patients with an absence of stromal Cav-1 underwent some form of recurrence (5/5) and the majority (4/5) underwent progression to invasive breast cancer. This represents an overall cumulative incidence rate of 100\% for recurrence and 80\% for progression. An absence of stromal Cav-1 in DCIS lesions was also specifically associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Conversely, ninety-seven percent of ER(+) DCIS patients (35/36) with high levels of stromal Cav-1 (score = 2) did not show any invasive recurrence over the duration of follow-up (4-208 mo), and 89\% of such patients are estimated to remain free of invasive recurrence, even after 15 y. Thus, determination of stromal Cav-1 levels may be a useful new biomarker for guiding the treatment of ER(+) DCIS patients.},

	Abstract = {Here, we investigated the possible predictive value of stromal
  caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a candidate biomarker for clinical outcome in triple
  negative (TN) breast cancer patients. A cohort of 85 TN breast cancer
  patients was available, with the necessary annotation and nearly 12 years of
  follow-up data. Our primary outcome of interest in this study was overall
  survival. Interestingly, TN patients with high-levels of stromal Cav-1 had a
  good clinical outcome, with >50\% of the patients remaining alive during the
  follow-up period. In contrast, the median survival for TN patients with
  moderate stromal Cav-1 staining was 33.5 months. Similarly, the median
  survival for TN patients with absent stromal Cav-1 staining was 25.7 months.
  A comparison of 5-year survival rates yields a similar pattern. TN patients
  with high stromal Cav-1 had a good 5-year survival rate, with 75.5\% of the
  patients remaining alive. In contrast, TN patients with moderate or absent
  stromal Cav-1 levels had progressively worse 5-year survival rates, with 40
  and 9.4\% of the patients remaining alive. In contrast, in a parallel
  analysis, the levels of tumor epithelial Cav-1 had no prognostic
  significance. As such, the prognostic value of Cav-1 immunostaining in TN
  breast cancer patients is compartment-specific, and selective for an absence
  of Cav-1 staining in the stromal fibroblast compartment. A
  recursive-partitioning algorithm was used to assess which factors are most
  predictive of overall survival in TN breast cancer patients. In this
  analysis, we included tumor size, histologic grade, whether the patient
  received surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, CK5/6, EGFR, p53 and Ki67
  status, as well as the stromal Cav-1 score. This analysis indicated that
  stromal loss of Cav-1 expression was the most important prognostic factor for
  overall survival in TN breast cancer. Virtually identical results were
  obtained with CK5/6 (+) and/or EGFR (+) TN breast cancer cases, demonstrating
  that a loss of stromal Cav-1 is also a strong prognostic factor for
  basal-like breast cancers. Our current findings may have important
  implications for the close monitoring and treatment stratification of TN and

	Abstract = {Previously, we showed that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is
  down-regulated in human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, it
  remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 occurs in the breast tumor stroma in
  vivo. Here, we immunostained a well-annotated breast cancer tissue microarray
  with antibodies against Cav-1 and scored its stromal expression. An absence
  of stromal Cav-1 was associated with early disease recurrence, advanced tumor
  stage, and lymph node metastasis, resulting in a 3.6-fold reduction in
  progression-free survival. When tamoxifen-treated patients were selected, an
  absence of stromal Cav-1 was a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome,
  suggestive of tamoxifen resistance. Interestingly, in lymph node-positive
  patients, an absence of stromal Cav-1 predicted an 11.5-fold reduction in
  5-year progression-free survival. Clinical outcomes among patients positive
  for HER2, and patients triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone
  receptor and HER2, were also strictly dependent on stromal Cav-1 levels. When
  our results were adjusted for tumor and nodal staging, an absence of stromal
  Cav-1 remained an independent predictor of poor outcome. Thus, stromal Cav-1
  expression can be used to stratify human breast cancer patients into low-risk
  and high-risk groups, and to predict their risk of early disease recurrence
  at diagnosis. Based on related mechanistic studies, we suggest that breast
  cancer patients lacking stromal Cav-1 might benefit from anti-angiogenic
  therapy in addition to standard regimens. We conclude that Cav-1 functions as
  a tumor suppressor in the stromal microenvironment.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that afflicts over
  35,000 Americans every year. Since therapeutic options are limited,
  understanding the molecular aspects of this disease is critical for moving
  towards targeted treatment of this aggressive form of cancer. Caveolin-1
  (Cav-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are two proteins that have been shown
  to be dysregulated in a number of cancers. Functionally these proteins have
  been shown to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis. We thus surveyed
  the expression of both these critical proteins in a series of pancreatic
  precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PanIN) and
  pancreatic cancers. Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated predominantly with
  clinical characteristics, such as histologic grade and advanced tumor stage
  (e.g., high Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated with poor differentiation
  status) and a significant survival advantage was found in patients with low
  co-expressing FASN and Cav-1 tumors. Cav-1 and FASN expression was absent in
  PanIN lesions and the normal ducts and acini. Of note, Cav-1 expression was
  detected in the fibroblasts of the desmoplastic pancreatic cancer stroma, but
  not in stromal cells of the normal pancreas. Mechanistically, these data
  support the notion that these proteins are co-regulated either directly or
  indirectly by another factor. Importantly, the co-expression of these
  proteins significantly correlates with clinical features and survival status
  of pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, Cav-1 and FASN may functionally
  cooperate in the process of pancreatic tumorigenesis, and as such, may be
  good candidate prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention.},

@article{Witkiewicz2012,
	Abstract = {We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to
  explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling
  tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the
  tumor stroma. This, in turn, drives L-lactate secretion from
  cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative
  mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in epithelial cancer cells, by acting as a
  paracrine onco-metabolite. We have previously termed this type of
  two-compartment tumor metabolism the "Reverse Warburg Effect," as aerobic
  glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer
  cells. Here, we used MCT4 immuno-staining of human breast cancer tissue
  microarrays (TMAs; > 180 triple-negative patients) to directly assess the
  prognostic value of the "Reverse Warburg Effect." MCT4 expression is a
  functional marker of hypoxia, oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, and
  L-lactate efflux. Remarkably, high stromal MCT4 levels (score = 2) were
  specifically associated with decreased overall survival (< 18\% survival at
  10 y post-diagnosis). In contrast, patients with absent stromal MCT4
  expression (score = 0), had 10-y survival rates of ~97\% (p-value < 10 (-32)
  ). High stromal levels of MCT4 were strictly correlated with a loss of
  stromal Cav-1 (p-value < 10 (-14) ), a known marker of early tumor recurrence
  and metastasis. In fact, the combined use of stromal Cav-1 and stromal MCT4
  allowed us to more precisely identify high-risk triple-negative breast cancer
  patients, consistent with the goal of individualized risk-assessment and
  personalized cancer treatment. However, epithelial MCT4 staining had no
  prognostic value, indicating that the "conventional" Warburg effect does not
  predict clinical outcome. Thus, the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "parasitic"
  energy-transfer is a key determinant of poor overall patient survival. As
  MCT4 is a druggable-target, MCT4 inhibitors should be developed for the
  treatment of aggressive breast cancers, and possibly other types of human
  cancers. Similarly, we discuss how stromal MCT4 could be used as a biomarker
  for identifying high-risk cancer patients that could likely benefit from
  treatment with FDA-approved drugs or existing MCT-inhibitors (such as,
  AR-C155858, AR-C117977, and AZD-3965).},

	Abstract = {Identification of the molecular changes that promote viability and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer is critical for the development of improved therapeutic interventions. Stat5a/b and Stat3 are both constitutively active in locally-confined and advanced prostate cancer, and both transcription factors have been reported to be critical for the viability of prostate cancer cells. We recently showed that Stat3 promotes metastatic behavior of human prostate cancer cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo experimental metastases model. In this work, we compare side-by-side Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in the promotion of prostate cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and induction of metastatic colonization in vivo. Inhibition of Stat5a/b induced massive death of prostate cancer cells in culture and reduced both subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumor growth, whereas Stat3 had a predominant role over Stat5a/b in promoting metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo in nude mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential biological effects induced by these two transcription factors involve largely different sets of genes regulated by Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in human prostate cancer model systems. Of the two Stat5 homologs, Stat5b was more important for supporting growth of prostate cancer cells than Stat5a. This work provides the first mechanistic comparison of the biological effects induced by transcription factors Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major consequence of lupus nephritis, but how this risk has changed over time is unknown. We conducted this systematic review to examine changes in ESRD among adults with lupus nephritis from 1971 to 2015 and to estimate risks of ESRD among contemporary patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for cohort studies and clinical trials on ESRD in adults with lupus nephritis. We analyzed studies from developed and developing countries separately. The outcome was probability of ESRD at 5, 10, and 15 years of lupus nephritis. We included 187 articles that reported on 18,309 patients. In developed countries, the 5-year risk of ESRD decreased from 16\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 14-17\%) in 1970-1979 to 11\% (95\% CI 10-12\%) in the mid-1990s and then plateaued. ESRD risks at 10 years and 15 years showed steeper declines in the 1970s and 1980s but also plateaued in 1993-1997, with a notable increase in the late 2000s. The decrease in risk after 1980 coincided with increased use of cyclophosphamide. The 15-year ESRD risk was higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Patients with class IV lupus nephritis had the greatest risk of ESRD, with a 15-year risk of 44\% during the 2000s. Risks of ESRD in lupus nephritis improved between the 1970s and the mid-1990s and then plateaued, with an increase in the late 2000s. This pattern suggests limitations in the effectiveness of, or access to, current treatments.},

@article{Szymczak2016,
	Abstract = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests (RFs) are a promising alternative to standard single SNP analyses in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). RFs provide variable importance measures (VIMs) to rank SNPs according to their predictive power. However, in contrast to the established genome-wide significance threshold, no clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs should be selected for downstream analyses. We propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent relative variable importance measure (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative to an observed minimal importance score for several runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in all of the runs are selected as important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show that the new method controls the number of false-positives under the null hypothesis. Under a simple alternative hypothesis with several independent main effects it is only slightly less powerful than logistic regression. In an experimental GWAS data set, the same strong signal is identified while the approach selects none of the SNPs in an underpowered GWAS. The novel variable selection method r2VIM is a promising extension to standard RF for objectively selecting relevant SNPs in GWAS while controlling the number of false-positive results.},

	Abstract = {Hospitals in which a high volume of arthroplasty procedures are performed have been observed to have better outcomes. As the number of arthroplasties has increased, it is not known whether surgical cases have shifted to high-volume hospitals. In this study, we examined the change in the volume of arthroplasties to provide a contemporary definition of "high-volume" centers, quantified surgical volume that shifted to high-volume centers, and investigated the resulting effect on complications. Data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (2000 to 2012) were used to quantify trends in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume. Elective primary THAs and TKAs were identified and grouped by hospital by utilizing the hospital identifier, which indicates the geographic location of the hospital. County geographic and population data were obtained from the U.S. Census, and the distances between hospitals and the centroids of counties were calculated. Risk-standardized surgical complication rates for hospitals (2009 to 2012) were obtained from Medicare Hospital Compare and grouped by hospital volume. From 2000 to 2012, there was a marked increase in the number of hospitals that performed a combined volume of {\^a}¥400 elective primary THAs and TKAs. The number of elective primary TKAs and THAs performed annually increased from 343,000 to 851,000. In 2012, 65.5\% of the arthroplasties were performed in high-volume hospitals ({\^a}¥400 arthroplasties annually), and 26.6\% of the arthroplasties were performed in very high-volume hospitals ({\^a}¥1,000 procedures annually). The proportion of arthroplasties performed in low-volume hospitals (<100 arthroplasties annually) shrank from 17.9\% to 5.4\%. Very high-volume hospitals had the lowest complication rates (2.745 per 100; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.56 to 2.93), and low-volume hospitals had the highest complication rates (3.610 per 100; 95\% CI, 3.58 to 3.64; p < 0.0001) (odds ratio, 1.327; 95\% CI, 1.26 to 1.40). Our analysis showed that 81.9\% of the U.S. population lived within 50 miles of a high-volume hospital. Arthroplasty patients are electing to have their procedures at higher-volume hospitals in the United States. Each successively higher hospital volume category manifested a lower complication rate.},

			Syndesmophytes occurred most often at the posterolateral vertebral
			rim, and least commonly at the posterior rim and anterior rim. In

	Abstract = {In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the patient global assessment (PGA) has been strongly associated with pain severity, but less often with other measures, including disease activity measures. We tested whether RA activity and psychological measures had direct associations with the PGA or indirect associations that were mediated by pain. We also tested whether the correlates of the PGA differed with the degree of RA activity. We studied 260 patients with active RA on 2 visits in a prospective longitudinal study. We used path analysis to test direct and indirect associations of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), fatigue, physical role limitations, social functioning, depressive symptoms, and health distress with the PGA. Among the 509 visits, the median PGA score was 50 (25th-75th percentile: 24-66). Pain severity had the strongest association with the PGA, but direct associations were also found for morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28. Morning stiffness severity, DAS28, health distress, and HAQ were also indirectly associated with the PGA through pain. Among visits with DAS28 ≥5.4, pain, morning stiffness severity, and HAQ were the only determinants of the PGA. Among visits with DAS28 <4.2, health distress and age were additional determinants, and fatigue was marginally associated with the PGA. Although pain was the strongest determinant of the PGA in RA, morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28 were also important. Determinants of the PGA differed with RA activity, with health distress, age, and to a lesser degree, fatigue, contributing only in patients with less active RA.},

	Abstract = {To compare the efficacy of 20 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the short-term treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We performed a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. We included trials that reported efficacy at 2-12 weeks. Efficacy outcomes were the change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. We also examined the number of adverse events. We used Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare effects directly and indirectly between drugs. We included 26 trials (66 treatment arms) of 20 NSAIDs with 3410 participants in the network meta-analysis. Fifty-eight per cent of trials had fewer than 50 participants. All 20 NSAIDs reduced pain more than placebo (standardised mean difference ranging from -0.65 to -2.2), with 15 NSAIDs significantly better than placebo. Etoricoxib was superior to celecoxib, ketoprofen and tenoxicam in pain reduction, but no other interdrug comparisons were significant. There were no significant differences among NSAIDs in decreases in the duration of morning stiffness or the likelihood of adverse events. Adverse events were uncommon in these short-term studies. In 16 trials that used NSAIDs at full doses, etoricoxib was superior to all but two other NSAIDs in pain reduction. Etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain in AS than some other NSAIDs, but there was otherwise insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular NSAID was more effective in the treatment of AS. Comparisons were limited by small studies.},

	Abstract = {Vestibular schwannomas (VS) can be managed by observation. The goals were to examine clinical, radiographic, and audiometric variables at presentation and during observation that may predict which patients fail conservative management. A retrospective chart review was performed of 202 patients who elected observation primarily. Data collection included presenting symptoms, symptom progression, tumor size, audiologic measures, and global clinical outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 16 years (mean, 2.48 yr). Nineteen patients (9.4\%) in the study group failed. Disequilibrium as a presenting symptom appeared more often in patients who failed observation (58\% versus 32\%; p = 0.039), as did new-onset disequilibrium. Presenting tumor size differed for patients who failed conservative management, with a mean of 14.0 versus 8.4 mm (p = 0.0006). Neurotologic complications compared favorably to those treated with primary surgery or radiotherapy. Patients with subjective disequilibrium at presentation and subjective disequilibrium developed during observation may be more likely to fail conservative management. Increased tumor size at presentation also may indicate the same, although no threshold could be achieved.},

@article{Tektonidou2017,
	Abstract = {Objective:  To determine trends in survival among adult and
	  pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from 1950 to
		  the present.
 ethods:  We performed a systematic literature review
		  to identify all published cohort studies on survival in patients with
		  SLE.  We used Bayesian methods to derive pooled survival estimates
		  separately for adult and pediatric patients, as well as for studies
		  from high income countries and low/middle income countries.  We
		  pooled contemporaneous studies to obtain trends in survival over
		  time.  We also examined trends in major causes of death.
 Results:
		  We identified 125 studies of adult patients and 51 studies of
		  pediatric patients.  Among adults, survival improved gradually from
		  the 1950's to the mid-1990's in both high income and low/middle
		  income countries, after which survival plateaued.  In 2008-2016, the
		  5-year, 10-year, and 15-year pooled survival estimates in adults from
		  high income countries were 0.95, 0.89, and 0.82, and in low/middle
		  income countries were 0.92, 0.85, and 0.79 respectively.   Among
		  children, in 2008-2016, the 5-year and 10-year pooled survival
		  estimates from high income countries were 0.99 and 0.97, while in
		  low/middle income countries were 0.85 and 0.79, respectively.  The
		  proportion of deaths due to SLE decreased over time in studies of
		  adults and among children from high income countries.
 Conclusions:
		  After a period of major improvement, survival in SLE has plateaued
		  since the mid-1990's.  In high income countries, 5-year survival
		  exceeds 0.95 in both adults and children.  In low/middle income
		  countries, 5-year and 10-year survival was lower among children than
		  adults.},

	Abstract = {Background:  Racial/ethnic minorities with end-stage renal disease have longer survival on dialysis than whites, but whether this is due to better health status or other factors is unclear.  We compared survival by race/ethnicity among patients hospitalized with one of four major health conditions, and tested if survival differences could be accounted for by differences in discontinuation of dialysis.  
ethods:  We performed a retrospective cohort study using the United States Renal Data System of survival after first hospitalization for either stroke, lung cancer, dementia, or failure to thrive among adults receiving maintenance dialysis.  We examined the frequency of discontinuation of dialysis after each hospitalization, and used simulations to estimate the survival of ethnic minorities relative to whites if minorities had the same pattern of dialysis discontinuation as whites.   
Results:  We studied 60,734 patients with stroke, 4100 patients with lung cancer, 40,084 patients dementia, and 42,950 patients with failure to thrive.  Risks of mortality with each condition were substantially lower for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians relative to whites.  The frequency of dialysis discontinuation among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians was about 50\% lower than among whites.  In simulations that assigned discontinuation patterns to be similar across ethnic groups, differences in survival were markedly attenuated and hazard ratios approached 1.0.  Survival and dialysis discontinuation frequencies among American Indians/Alaska Natives were closer to those of whites.  
Conclusions:  Survival differences following hospitalization with major conditions between ethnic minorities and whites on maintenance dialysis are largely attributable to racial/ethnic differences in discontinuation of dialysis.
